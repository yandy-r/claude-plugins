_PLAN_OVERVIEW = """## What This Skill Does

1. Parse `--parallel`, `--enhanced`, `--dry-run`, `--no-worktree`, `--worktree`,
   and `--visual`, then read the request and referenced files.
2. Dispatch one planner by default, three standalone planning perspectives when
   the user explicitly asks for a multi-perspective plan, or five perspectives
   when `--enhanced` is present.
3. Validate and merge every returned perspective into one plan.
4. Wait for explicit user confirmation before any implementation.

## Flags

| Flag | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `--parallel` | Shape the plan for dependency-batched parallel implementation. |
| `--enhanced` | Use five standalone perspectives: architecture, risk, testing, security, and UX. |
| `--dry-run` | Print the selected multi-perspective roster and stop without dispatching. |
| `--worktree` | Legacy no-op; shared worktree annotations are enabled by default. |
| `--no-worktree` | Omit shared worktree annotations. |
| `--visual` | Force-write the confirmed plan and render it with `visual-plan`. |

`--parallel` changes the output shape, independently of whether one, three, or
five planning perspectives are dispatched. `--enhanced` selects five
perspectives. An explicit natural-language request for a multi-perspective plan
selects three perspectives when `--enhanced` is absent.

"""

_PLAN_PARSE = """### Step 1 — Parse flags and the user's request

Strip the supported flags from `$ARGUMENTS`. Set `PARALLEL_MODE`,
`ENHANCED_MODE`, `DRY_RUN`, `VISUAL_MODE`, and `WORKTREE_MODE` explicitly.
Default `WORKTREE_MODE=true`; `--no-worktree` sets it false and `--worktree` is
a legacy no-op. Set `PERSPECTIVE_COUNT=5` when `ENHANCED_MODE=true`, otherwise
set it to `3` only when the remaining request explicitly asks for a
multi-perspective plan; default it to `1`.

Read the stripped request and any referenced files. Ask one focused question
before dispatch if the request is ambiguous. `--dry-run` with
`PERSPECTIVE_COUNT=1` aborts because the single-agent path has no roster to
preview.

"""

_PLAN_DISPATCH = """### Step 2 — Dispatch

- `PERSPECTIVE_COUNT=1`: one foreground `planner` call.
- `PERSPECTIVE_COUNT=3`: `architect` (`planner`), `risk-analyst`
  (`codebase-research-analyst`), and `test-strategist`
  (`test-strategy-planner`) in one parallel foreground batch.
- `PERSPECTIVE_COUNT=5`: the same three plus `security-reviewer` and
  `ux-reviewer` (both `research-specialist`) in one parallel foreground batch.

Every call uses the native shape below, with a complete role-specific prompt and
no `sessionID` for a new child:

```text
subagent(agent="<configured-agent>", description="<perspective>",
         prompt="<complete planning prompt>", background=false)
```

Do not set `model`; each configured agent supplies or inherits its model. Include
the original request, referenced context, role focus, confirmation instruction,
and the parallel/worktree directives selected by the flags.

When `DRY_RUN=true`, print the selected three- or five-persona roster and stop
without calling `subagent`.

For a single planner, relay the validated report. For three or five perspectives,
merge architecture, risks, testing, and optional security/UX slices without
dropping a role. A terminal lifecycle state alone is insufficient: require each
candidate report and validate any declared artifact. For contentless completion,
record `sessionID`, inspect edits/artifacts, preserve work, retry at most once,
then report the missing perspective. Follow
`~/.config/opencode/shared/references/standalone-dispatch.md`.
