## Mandatory Reading

Files that MUST be read before implementing:

| Priority       | File           | Lines | Why                    |
| -------------- | -------------- | ----- | ---------------------- |
| P0 (critical)  | `path/to/file` | 1-50  | Core pattern to follow |
| P1 (important) | `path/to/file` | 10-30 | Related types          |
| P2 (reference) | `path/to/file` | all   | Similar implementation |

[project-specific type check command]
```

EXPECT: Zero type errors

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run tests for affected area
[project-specific test command]
```

EXPECT: All tests pass

### Full Test Suite

```bash
# Run complete test suite
[project-specific full test command]
```

EXPECT: No regressions

### Database Validation (if applicable)

```bash
# Verify schema/migrations
[project-specific db command]
```

EXPECT: Schema up to date

### Browser Validation (if applicable)

```bash
# Start dev server and verify
[project-specific dev server command]
```

EXPECT: Feature works as designed

### Manual Validation
