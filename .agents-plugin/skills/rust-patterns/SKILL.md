description: Idiomatic Rust patterns, ownership, error handling, traits, concurrency,
  and best practices for building safe, performant applications. Use when the user
  is writing new Rust code, reviewing Rust code, refactoring Rust, designing crate
  structure, asks "how should I structure this in Rust", asks about Rust ownership/borrowing/lifetimes,
  asks about error handling with Result/thiserror/anyhow, asks about Rust traits/generics/trait
  objects, asks about Arc/Mutex/channels/async, or wants Rust idioms and anti-patterns.

# Rust Development Patterns

Idiomatic Rust patterns and best practices for building safe, performant, and maintainable applications.

## When to Use

- Writing new Rust code
- Reviewing Rust code
- Refactoring existing Rust code
- Designing crate structure and module layout

## How It Works

This skill enforces idiomatic Rust conventions across six key areas: ownership and borrowing to prevent data races at compile time, `Result`/`?` error propagation with `thiserror` for libraries and `anyhow` for applications, enums and exhaustive pattern matching to make illegal states unrepresentable, traits and generics for zero-cost abstraction, safe concurrency via `Arc<Mutex<T>>`, channels, and async/await, and minimal `pub` surfaces organized by domain.

## Critical Rules

- Borrow by default; take ownership only to store or consume; avoid clones to appease the borrow checker.
- Use `Result` with `?` for error propagation — no `unwrap()` in production or library code.
- `thiserror` for libraries, `anyhow` for applications; avoid `Box<dyn Error>` in library APIs.
- Match exhaustively on business-critical enums — no wildcard `_` arms.
- Use newtypes to wrap primitives and prevent argument mix-ups.
- Keep `pub` surface minimal; `pub(crate)` for internal APIs.
- Every `unsafe` block needs a `// SAFETY:` comment stating the invariant.

  Read when: structs and data modeling, newtypes; iterators and closures; concurrency (`Arc`, `Mutex`, channels, async); unsafe code with SAFETY invariants; module system and crate structure; tooling (clippy, rustfmt, cargo commands).

## Quick Reference: Rust Idioms

| Idiom                               | Description                                                |
| ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Borrow, don't clone                 | Pass `&T` instead of cloning unless ownership is needed    |
| Make illegal states unrepresentable | Use enums to model valid states only                       |
| `?` over `unwrap()`                 | Propagate errors, never panic in library/production code   |
| Parse, don't validate               | Convert unstructured data to typed structs at the boundary |
| Newtype for type safety             | Wrap primitives in newtypes to prevent argument swaps      |
| Prefer iterators over loops         | Declarative chains are clearer and often faster            |
| `#[must_use]` on Results            | Ensure callers handle return values                        |
| `Cow` for flexible ownership        | Avoid allocations when borrowing suffices                  |
| Exhaustive matching                 | No wildcard `_` for business-critical enums                |
| Minimal `pub` surface               | Use `pub(crate)` for internal APIs                         |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```rust
// Bad: .unwrap() in production code
let value = map.get("key").unwrap();

// Bad: .clone() to satisfy borrow checker without understanding why
let data = expensive_data.clone();
process(&original, &data);

// Bad: Using String when &str suffices
fn greet(name: String) { /* should be &str */ }

// Bad: Box<dyn Error> in libraries (use thiserror instead)
fn parse(input: &str) -> Result<Data, Box<dyn std::error::Error>> { todo!() }

// Bad: Ignoring must_use warnings
let _ = validate(input); // Silently discarding a Result

// Bad: Blocking in async context
async fn bad_async() {
    std::thread::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)); // Blocks the executor!
    // Use: tokio::time::sleep(Duration::from_secs(1)).await;
}
```

**Remember**: If it compiles, it's probably correct — but only if you avoid `unwrap()`, minimize `unsafe`, and let the type system work for you.
