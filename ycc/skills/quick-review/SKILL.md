name: quick-review
description: Fast interactive review of uncommitted changes — prints findings inline, writes nothing by default. "Apply fixes" hands findings to /ycc:quick-fix; "Save to file" writes an artifact under docs/prps/reviews; "Write file and apply fixes" hands off to /ycc:review-fix. For short changes where a full /ycc:code-review artifact is overkill. Use when the user asks to "quick review", "fast review", "review what I have", "on-the-fly review", or says "/quick-review".

# Quick Review

Interactive low-friction review of uncommitted changes. Output is **inline**.
The default fix path is artifact-free.

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS`

**Core rule**: "Apply fixes" MUST NOT write a review artifact. It hands the
inline findings directly to `/ycc:quick-fix`. Only "Save to file" and
"Write file and apply fixes" write `docs/prps/reviews/quick-*.md`.

---

## Phase 0 — Parse flags

Extract flags from `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Flag                 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--parallel`         | Fan out REVIEW across 3 standalone `ycc:code-reviewer` sub-agents (correctness, security, quality) and merge findings. Works in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex bundles.                                   |
| `--team`             | (Claude Code only) Same 3-reviewer fan-out as a coordinated agent team with `TeamCreate`, shared `TaskList`, per-reviewer `TaskCreate`, and coordinated shutdown. Heavier dispatch, richer communication. |
| `--yes`              | Skip the confirmation prompt and behave as "Apply fixes" through `/ycc:quick-fix`. Mutually exclusive with `--save` and `--write-and-apply`.                                                              |
| `--save`             | Skip the confirmation prompt and behave as "Save to file" (write artifact, print Next steps, exit). Mutually exclusive with `--yes` and `--write-and-apply`.                                              |
| `--write-and-apply`  | Skip the confirmation prompt, write the review artifact, then hand off to `/ycc:review-fix`. Mutually exclusive with `--yes` and `--save`.                                                                |
| `--severity <level>` | Forwarded to `/ycc:quick-fix` or `/ycc:review-fix` during hand-off. Valid: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`. Default: `HIGH`. Ignored on "Save to file" / "Discard".                                   |
| `--no-worktree`      | Accepted as a **no-op**. Quick mode never creates a worktree. Emit a note: `--no-worktree has no effect in quick mode.`                                                                                   |

Strip these from `$ARGUMENTS` and set `PARALLEL_MODE`, `AGENT_TEAM_MODE`,
`AUTO_YES`, `AUTO_SAVE`, `AUTO_WRITE_AND_APPLY`, and `MIN_SEVERITY` (default
`HIGH`). The remaining text MUST be empty; if not, abort with:

```
Error: /ycc:quick-review takes no positional argument (only flags).
```

**Validation**:

- `--parallel` and `--team` mutually exclusive -> abort with: `--parallel and --team are mutually exclusive. Pick one.`
- More than one of `--yes`, `--save`, `--write-and-apply` present -> abort with: `--yes, --save, and --write-and-apply are mutually exclusive. Pick one.`
- `--team` in a Cursor/Codex bundle (no `TeamCreate` tool) -> abort with: `--team is not supported in bundle invocations; use --parallel instead.`
- `--severity` value not one of `CRITICAL|HIGH|MEDIUM|LOW` -> abort with: `Invalid --severity value. Use CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, or LOW.`

---

## Phase 1 — GATHER

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

If the output is empty, print `Nothing to review.` and exit. Do NOT prompt,
do NOT write anything.

Capture the list of changed files as `CHANGED_FILES` for the REVIEW phase.

---

## Phase 2 — REVIEW

The shape of this phase depends on `PARALLEL_MODE` and `AGENT_TEAM_MODE`:

| Flags             | Path                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Neither set       | **Path A** — single-pass review (default)   |
| `PARALLEL_MODE`   | **Path B** — 3 parallel sub-agent reviewers |
| `AGENT_TEAM_MODE` | **Path C** — 3-reviewer agent team          |

Findings from all paths stay **in memory**. Do not write to disk here.

### Path A — Single-Pass Review (default)

Read each changed file in full and apply the **Local / Quick Review —
Single-Pass Checklist** and **Severity Rubric** from:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/references/review-checklist.md
```

### Path B — Parallel Sub-Agent Review (`PARALLEL_MODE=true`)

Dispatch **3 standalone `ycc:code-reviewer` sub-agents in parallel** in a SINGLE
message with MULTIPLE `Agent` tool calls. Use the **Local / Quick Mode Roster**
and **Standard Findings Format** from:

```
${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/references/review-checklist.md
```

Each reviewer prompt must include:

1. The list of changed files (`git diff --name-only HEAD`)
2. Its assigned focus and checklist items (from the roster table)
3. The severity rubric
4. A directive to return findings in the Standard Findings Format

Apply the **Merge Procedure** defined in the reference to produce a single
combined findings list for Phase 3.

### Path C — Agent Team Review (`AGENT_TEAM_MODE=true`, Claude Code only)

> **MANDATORY — AGENT TEAMS REQUIRED**
>
> You MUST follow the agent-team lifecycle. Every `Agent` call MUST include
> `team_name=` AND `name=`. See
> `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/references/agent-team-dispatch.md`.

Roster and category split identical to Path B.

#### C.1 Build the team name

Team name: `qrev-local-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`. Generate the timestamp once at the
start of Phase 2 and reuse it if the user later selects an artifact-writing
path.

#### C.2 Create the team

```
TeamCreate: team_name="qrev-local-<timestamp>", description="Quick review team for uncommitted local changes"
```

On failure, abort.

#### C.3 Register subtasks

Create 3 tasks in the shared task list (flat graph — reviewers are independent):

```
TaskCreate: subject="correctness-reviewer: code-quality review of uncommitted changes", description="<full reviewer prompt>"
TaskCreate: subject="security-reviewer: security review of uncommitted changes",        description="<full reviewer prompt>"
TaskCreate: subject="quality-reviewer: best-practices review of uncommitted changes",   description="<full reviewer prompt>"
```

If any `TaskCreate` fails -> `TeamDelete`, abort.

#### C.4 Spawn the 3 reviewers

Single message, three `Agent` calls. Every call MUST include `team_name`, `name`
(matching the `TaskCreate` subject prefix), `subagent_type="ycc:code-reviewer"`,
description, and a prompt equivalent to Path B's reviewer prompt plus a note
that the teammate shares a task list with two siblings (name them) and may
`SendMessage` them on overlaps, and must call `TaskUpdate` to mark its task
complete before returning.

#### C.5 Monitor and collect results

Use `TaskList` until all 3 tasks are `completed`. Failure policy:

- All 3 error -> `TeamDelete`, abort with a clear error.
- 1 or 2 error -> record "partial review — {role} did not complete" and proceed
  with the remaining findings. Note the gap when printing inline.

#### C.6 Shutdown and cleanup

```
SendMessage(to="correctness-reviewer", message={type:"shutdown_request"})
SendMessage(to="security-reviewer",    message={type:"shutdown_request"})
SendMessage(to="quality-reviewer",     message={type:"shutdown_request"})
TeamDelete
```

Always `TeamDelete` — even on abort or partial failure.

#### C.7 Merge findings

Apply the reference's Merge Procedure and pass the combined findings to Phase 3.

---

## Phase 3 — REPORT (inline)

Assign sequential finding IDs (`F001`, `F002`, ...) ordered by severity
(CRITICAL first) then by file path. Every finding gets `Status: Open`.

Compute:

- `critical_count`, `high_count`, `medium_count`, `low_count`
- `total_findings`
- `finding_file_count` (unique files with findings)
- `large_review = total_findings >= 5 || finding_file_count >= 3`

**Print** the review to stdout in the Review Artifact Format, **without**
writing a file. The printed block looks like:

```markdown
# Quick Review — Uncommitted Changes

**Reviewed**: <ISO date>
**Mode**: Quick (inline)
**Author**: local
**Branch**: <current-branch>
**Decision**: (pending user confirmation)

## Summary

<1-2 sentence overall assessment>

## Findings

### CRITICAL

- **[F001]** `file:line` — <description>
  - **Status**: Open
  - **Category**: <Security | Correctness | Code Quality | Best Practices>
  - **Suggested fix**: <concrete fix>

### HIGH

- **[F002]** ...
  - **Status**: Open
  - ...

### MEDIUM

- **[F003]** ...
  - **Status**: Open
  - ...

### LOW

- **[F004]** ...
  - **Status**: Open
  - ...

## Files Reviewed

- `file1.ts` (Modified)
- `file2.ts` (Added)
```

**Omissions** (vs. the standard Review Artifact Format): no
`## Worktree Setup` section (quick mode never creates a worktree) and no
`## Validation Results` section (quick mode does not run toolchain checks).

After the artifact block, print:

```
Findings: [C] {critical_count}  [H] {high_count}  [M] {medium_count}  [L] {low_count}
```

If `large_review=true`, also print:

```
Large quick review: {total_findings} findings across {finding_file_count} files.
You can still apply fixes directly, or write an artifact before applying fixes for an audit trail.
```

If the count is zero across all severities, skip Phase 4 entirely. Print
`No findings. Nothing to do.` and exit.

Keep the exact printed review block in memory as `INLINE_REVIEW_PAYLOAD` for
`/ycc:quick-fix` or artifact writing.

---

## Phase 4 — DECIDE (confirmation)

If `AUTO_YES=true` -> skip this phase, proceed directly to Phase 5 as if the
user selected "Apply fixes".

If `AUTO_SAVE=true` -> skip this phase, proceed directly to Phase 5 as if the
user selected "Save to file".

If `AUTO_WRITE_AND_APPLY=true` -> skip this phase, proceed directly to Phase 5
as if the user selected "Write file and apply fixes".

Otherwise, ask the user with `AskUserQuestion`.

For normal reviews (`large_review=false`):

```
question: "What should I do with this review?"
header:   "Review action"
options:
  - label: "Apply fixes"
    description: "Hand findings directly to /ycc:quick-fix. No review file is written. (recommended)"
  - label: "Save to file"
    description: "Write docs/prps/reviews/quick-<timestamp>-review.md and stop."
  - label: "Discard"
    description: "Write nothing, exit"
```

For large reviews (`large_review=true`):

```
question: "This is a larger quick review. What should I do?"
header:   "Review action"
options:
  - label: "Apply fixes"
    description: "Hand findings directly to /ycc:quick-fix. No review file is written."
  - label: "Write file and apply fixes"
    description: "Write docs/prps/reviews/quick-<timestamp>-review.md, then use /ycc:review-fix for an audit trail. (recommended)"
  - label: "Save to file"
    description: "Write docs/prps/reviews/quick-<timestamp>-review.md and stop."
  - label: "Discard"
    description: "Write nothing, exit"
```

Mark "Apply fixes" with `(Recommended)` when `large_review=false` and
`critical_count + high_count > 0`. Mark "Write file and apply fixes" with
`(Recommended)` when `large_review=true`.

**Text-mode fallback** (if `AskUserQuestion` is unavailable — Cursor/Codex
bundles without that tool): print the available choices explicitly and WAIT for
the user's next message. Parse their reply case-insensitively:

- `yes` / `apply` / `apply fixes` / `fix` -> "Apply fixes"
- `write and apply` / `write file and apply fixes` / `file and fix` / `artifact and fix` -> "Write file and apply fixes"
- `save` / `save to file` / `write` / `file` -> "Save to file"
- `no` / `discard` / `cancel` / `skip` -> "Discard"
- Anything else -> re-prompt once, then default to `Discard` if still ambiguous.

---

## Phase 5 — HAND-OFF

Branch on the user's selection (or auto-confirm flag).

### Selection: "Discard"

Print `Discarded. No artifact written.` and exit. Do NOT write any file.

### Selection: "Apply fixes"

Invoke the `ycc:quick-fix` skill inline via the `Skill` tool. Do NOT write an
artifact first.

- `skill`: `"ycc:quick-fix"`
- `args`: `"[--parallel] [--severity <level>] <INLINE_REVIEW_PAYLOAD>"`

Forward `--parallel` if `PARALLEL_MODE=true`. Forward `--severity <level>` when
`MIN_SEVERITY != HIGH` (HIGH is the default on quick-fix).

After the Skill call returns, print:

```
Fixes complete. No review artifact was written.
```

Exit.

### Selection: "Save to file"

Write the artifact to disk using the Phase 3 content plus the canonical header
block:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/prps/reviews
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)    # reuse the Path C timestamp if set
REVIEW_FILE="docs/prps/reviews/quick-${TIMESTAMP}-review.md"
```

Write the same artifact content that was printed in Phase 3, but set
`**Decision**: COMMENT` in the header (since a review was produced but no
GitHub decision is being posted).

Print:

```
Quick review written to: docs/prps/reviews/quick-<TIMESTAMP>-review.md
Findings: [C] {critical_count}  [H] {high_count}  [M] {medium_count}  [L] {low_count}

Next steps:
  /ycc:review-fix docs/prps/reviews/quick-<TIMESTAMP>-review.md              # apply fixes {recommended_single if 1-2 Open findings}
  /ycc:review-fix docs/prps/reviews/quick-<TIMESTAMP>-review.md --parallel   # fan out fixes {recommended_parallel if 3+ Open across 2+ files}
```

Annotate ONE command with `# <- recommended`:

- 1-2 Open findings -> recommend the single-pass form.
- 3+ Open findings spanning 2+ files -> recommend the `--parallel` form.
- Otherwise default to the single-pass form.

Exit.

### Selection: "Write file and apply fixes"

Step 1 — write the artifact to disk exactly as in "Save to file".

Step 2 — invoke the `ycc:review-fix` skill inline via the `Skill` tool:

- `skill`: `"ycc:review-fix"`
- `args`: `"<REVIEW_FILE> [--parallel] [--severity <level>]"`

Forward `--parallel` if `PARALLEL_MODE=true`. Forward `--severity <level>` when
`MIN_SEVERITY != HIGH`.

Step 3 — after the Skill call returns, print:

```
Fixes complete. Review artifact updated in place: docs/prps/reviews/quick-<TIMESTAMP>-review.md
```

Step 4 — exit.

**Note**: `--team` from quick-review is NOT forwarded to either fix workflow
automatically. The review-phase fan-out is about finding issues quickly; the
fix phase has its own execution decision.

---

## Important Notes

- **Apply fixes is artifact-free**: direct apply MUST route to `/ycc:quick-fix`
  without writing `docs/prps/reviews/quick-*.md`.
- **Large reviews are advisory**: `5+` findings or `3+` finding files adds a
  "Write file and apply fixes" choice. It does not force artifact creation.
- **Explicit artifact-backed apply**: only `--write-and-apply` or the matching
  prompt choice writes the artifact and invokes `/ycc:review-fix`.
- **Idempotent filename**: the `quick-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-review.md` pattern
  produces a new file per artifact-writing invocation — no overwrites.
- **Not a replacement for `/ycc:code-review`**: if you need toolchain
  validation (typecheck/lint/test/build), a `## Validation Results` block,
  worktree isolation, or a GitHub review posted, use `/ycc:code-review`
  without `--quick`.

---

## Integration with ycc

- `/ycc:code-review --quick` delegates to this skill.
- `/ycc:quick-fix` consumes inline findings for artifact-free fixing.
- `/ycc:review-fix` consumes written artifacts only.
- `/ycc:prp-commit` or `/ycc:git-workflow --commit` can commit the fixes afterward.
