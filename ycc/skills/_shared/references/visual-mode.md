# Visual Mode — Canonical Reference

Used by `ycc:prp-plan`, `ycc:plan`, `ycc:parallel-plan`, and `ycc:plan-workflow`
to expose a uniform `--visual` decorator. This file documents the **single
`--visual` contract** shared by all four planning skills: when it runs, how it
composes with other flags, how `--dry-run` short-circuits it, and the hand-off
to `ycc:visual-plan`. Individual skills own their own flag plumbing and the path
where they write a plan; the shared **invariant** lives here.

`--visual` is a **terminal decorator step**, not a dispatch mode. It does not
change how a plan is researched, dispatched, or written — it only runs once,
**after** the plan exists and has been validated, to produce a visual rendering
of that plan.

See [worktree-strategy.md](./worktree-strategy.md) for where plan artifacts live
and [agent-team-dispatch.md](./agent-team-dispatch.md) for the team lifecycle
that `--team` layers on top of planning.

## 0. Default Behavior

`--visual` is **off by default** on all four planning skills. When omitted, the
skill behaves exactly as it does today and writes no visual output.

| Skill               | Writes a plan artifact by default?   | `--visual` target                         |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
| `ycc:prp-plan`      | yes — `docs/prps/plans/*.plan.md`    | the written plan file                     |
| `ycc:parallel-plan` | yes — feature-dir `parallel-plan.md` | the written plan file                     |
| `ycc:plan-workflow` | yes — feature-dir `parallel-plan.md` | the written plan file                     |
| `ycc:plan`          | **no** — plan kept in-chat           | a plan file `--visual` is forced to write |

The plan path differs per skill (and `ycc:plan` writes none by default). The
contract therefore never hardcodes `docs/prps/plans`; it passes whatever
absolute plan path the skill produced to `ycc:visual-plan` and lets that skill
derive its output directory. See §3 (hand-off) and §4 (`ycc:plan` special case).

---

## 1. Timing — runs AFTER write AND validation

`--visual` is the **last** step of a planning run. The order is fixed:

1. Research / dispatch / plan generation (unchanged by `--visual`).
2. Write the plan artifact to its skill-specific path.
3. **Validate** the plan per the skill's existing rules.
4. **Only then** run the `--visual` decorator step.

If steps 1–3 do not complete (research aborts, write fails, or validation
fails), the `--visual` step does **not** run. There is nothing valid to
visualize, so the skill reports the upstream failure and stops.

`--visual` never re-orders, re-runs, or substitutes for any earlier phase.

---

## 2. Composition with other flags

`--visual` is **orthogonal** to and **composes with** the dispatch/runtime
flags. It is applied once, at the end, regardless of which of these are present:

| Flag            | Interaction with `--visual`                                                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `--parallel`    | Independent. Parallel dispatch finishes, plan is written + validated, then `--visual` runs once. |
| `--team`        | Independent. Team lifecycle completes first; `--visual` decorates the final plan.                |
| `--enhanced`    | Independent. Enhancement affects plan content; `--visual` renders the enhanced result.           |
| `--no-worktree` | Independent. Worktree opt-out does not affect whether or how `--visual` runs.                    |
| `--dry-run`     | **Short-circuits** `--visual` (see §2.1).                                                        |

Because `--visual` is a terminal decorator, the combination
`--parallel --team --visual` (etc.) means: do the parallel/team planning, write

- validate the plan, then run the single `--visual` step on the result.

### 2.1 `--dry-run` short-circuit

When `--dry-run` is present, `--visual` is **short-circuited**: the skill prints

```
visual generation would run
```

and does **not** generate anything and does **not** invoke `ycc:visual-plan`.
`--dry-run` always wins over `--visual`; no visual artifacts, directories, or
links are produced in a dry run.

---

## 3. Hand-off to `ycc:visual-plan`

When `--visual` runs for real (not `--dry-run`), the planning skill invokes:

```
ycc:visual-plan <absolute-plan-path>
```

passing the **absolute path** of the plan file it wrote and validated.

Contract for `ycc:visual-plan`:

- **Accept ANY plan path.** It must not assume `docs/prps/plans` or any other
  fixed location. The plan path is supplied by the caller and may live anywhere
  (e.g. `docs/prps/plans/<name>.plan.md`, a feature-dir `parallel-plan.md`, or a
  forced-write file from `ycc:plan`).
- **Derive `visual/` relative to the given plan path.** The output directory is
  a `visual/` sibling of the plan file — i.e. `<dirname of plan>/visual/` —
  computed from the path it was handed, never hardcoded.
- **Print the resulting link to stdout.** Exactly one of:
  - a hosted shareable URL, or
  - a localhost preview `http://127.0.0.1:PORT/...`, or
  - `local files only` when no server/host is available.
- **NEVER re-run research or dispatch.** It only consumes an existing plan.
- **NEVER edit the plan file.** It reads the plan and writes only into the
  derived `visual/` directory; the plan artifact is left byte-for-byte intact.

The planning skill surfaces whatever link `ycc:visual-plan` prints; it does not
re-derive the path itself.

---

## 4. `/ycc:plan --visual` special case — force a write FIRST

`ycc:plan` writes **no** artifact by default (the plan stays in-chat). There is
therefore nothing on disk to visualize. When `--visual` is passed to
`ycc:plan`:

1. `ycc:plan` **MUST force a plan-file write first**, producing an absolute plan
   path on disk (this write happens even though it would normally be skipped).
2. That forced write is then validated like any other plan.
3. Only after a valid file exists does `ycc:plan` hand the absolute path to
   `ycc:visual-plan <absolute-plan-path>`.

Without the forced write there is no input for `ycc:visual-plan`, so the
force-write rule is mandatory — not optional — for `ycc:plan --visual`. Under
`--dry-run` this is moot: the §2.1 short-circuit applies and `ycc:plan` prints
`visual generation would run` without forcing any write.

## 5. NAMING_CONVENTION

In-body references to skill assets use the plugin-root variable, e.g.:

- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/visual-plan/SKILL.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plan/SKILL.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/prp-plan/SKILL.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/parallel-plan/SKILL.md`
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/plan-workflow/SKILL.md`

The hand-off is always expressed as the skill invocation
`ycc:visual-plan <absolute-plan-path>`, with `<absolute-plan-path>` resolved by
the calling skill to a real, absolute path on disk.
