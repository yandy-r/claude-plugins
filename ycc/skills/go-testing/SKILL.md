description: Go testing patterns including table-driven tests, subtests, benchmarks, fuzzing, and test coverage. Follows TDD methodology with idiomatic Go practices. Use when the user is writing Go tests, adding test coverage to Go code, asks about table-driven tests, t.Run subtests, t.Helper/t.Cleanup/t.TempDir, testing.B benchmarks, Go 1.18+ fuzzing (f.Fuzz), httptest handler testing, golden files, interface-based mocks, or wants TDD guidance for a Go project.

# Go Testing Patterns

Comprehensive Go testing patterns for writing reliable, maintainable tests following TDD methodology.

## When to Activate

- Writing new Go functions or methods
- Adding test coverage to existing code
- Creating benchmarks for performance-critical code
- Implementing fuzz tests for input validation
- Following TDD workflow in Go projects

## Critical Rules

- Write the failing test first (RED-GREEN-REFACTOR).
- Use table-driven tests with `t.Run` subtests.
- Mark helpers with `t.Helper()`; use `t.Cleanup()` and `t.TempDir()` for cleanup.
- Run tests with `-race`.
- Do not use `time.Sleep()` for synchronization; use channels or conditions.
- Test error paths, not only the happy path.
- Test behavior through the public API, not private functions.

## Test Coverage

### Running Coverage

```bash
# Basic coverage
go test -cover ./...

# Generate coverage profile
go test -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# View coverage in browser
go tool cover -html=coverage.out

# View coverage by function
go tool cover -func=coverage.out

# Coverage with race detection
go test -race -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...
```

### Coverage Targets

| Code Type               | Target  |
| ----------------------- | ------- |
| Critical business logic | 100%    |
| Public APIs             | 90%+    |
| General code            | 80%+    |
| Generated code          | Exclude |

### Excluding Generated Code from Coverage

```go
//go:generate mockgen -source=interface.go -destination=mock_interface.go

// In coverage profile, exclude with build tags:
// go test -cover -tags=!generate ./...
```

## Testing Commands

```bash
# Run all tests
go test ./...

# Run tests with verbose output
go test -v ./...

# Run specific test
go test -run TestAdd ./...

# Run tests matching pattern
go test -run "TestUser/Create" ./...

# Run tests with race detector
go test -race ./...

# Run tests with coverage
go test -cover -coverprofile=coverage.out ./...

# Run short tests only
go test -short ./...

# Run tests with timeout
go test -timeout 30s ./...

# Run benchmarks
go test -bench=. -benchmem ./...

# Run fuzzing
go test -fuzz=FuzzParse -fuzztime=30s ./...

# Count test runs (for flaky test detection)
go test -count=10 ./...
```

## Best Practices

**DO:**

- Write tests FIRST (TDD)
- Use table-driven tests for comprehensive coverage
- Test behavior, not implementation
- Use `t.Helper()` in helper functions
- Use `t.Parallel()` for independent tests
- Clean up resources with `t.Cleanup()`
- Use meaningful test names that describe the scenario

**DON'T:**

- Test private functions directly (test through public API)
- Use `time.Sleep()` in tests (use channels or conditions)
- Ignore flaky tests (fix or remove them)
- Mock everything (prefer integration tests when possible)
- Skip error path testing
