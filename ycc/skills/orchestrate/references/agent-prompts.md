# Agent Prompt Templates

Standard prompt templates for common orchestration patterns. Use these to ensure consistent, high-quality agent instructions. All templates include a Team Communication section for agent team coordination.

## Team Communication Section (Include in ALL Prompts)

Insert this section into every agent prompt template:

```markdown
## Team Communication

You are part of an orchestration team working on batch {{BATCH_NUMBER}} for: "{{TASK}}"

### Your Teammates (This Batch)

{{BATCH_TEAMMATES}}

### What to Share (via SendMessage)

After completing your work, share relevant findings with teammates:

- **Utility functions, helpers, or shared code** you created that teammates might need
- **API patterns, interfaces, or contracts** you established
- **Unexpected findings or breaking changes** discovered during implementation
- **Integration points** other teammates should know about

Only share findings that are genuinely useful to specific teammates. Use targeted messages.

### What to Listen For

Your teammates may message you with:

- Shared code or utilities they created
- Interface contracts or API patterns
- Warnings about unexpected codebase state

Integrate any relevant information from teammate messages into your work.

### Task Coordination

1. Check TaskList for your assigned task
2. Claim your task with TaskUpdate (set status to in_progress, owner to your name)
3. Read all context files
4. Implement your subtask
5. Share key findings with relevant teammates via SendMessage
6. Validate your work
7. Mark your task complete with TaskUpdate (set status to completed)
```

## Best Practices for Using Templates

1. **Always fill all variables**: Don't leave placeholders like {{TASK}} in the actual prompt
2. **Always include Team Communication**: Every agent prompt MUST have the team section
3. **Substitute BATCH_TEAMMATES**: List the other teammates in the same batch
4. **Add specific context**: Templates are starting points — add project-specific details
5. **Adjust scope**: Narrow or expand based on subtask complexity
6. **Include examples**: Reference actual files from the codebase
7. **Set clear boundaries**: Explicitly state what NOT to do
8. **Specify output format**: Be clear about expected deliverables
9. **Link related work**: Help agents understand their place in the bigger picture

---

## Customizing Templates

When adapting templates:

1. **Add technology-specific details**: Framework, libraries, tools being used
2. **Include architectural constraints**: Design patterns, conventions, restrictions
3. **Reference style guides**: Code style, naming conventions, formatting
4. **Specify integration points**: How this connects to other components
5. **Add validation criteria**: How to verify the work is complete and correct
6. **Customize team communication**: Tailor what each agent should share based on their role

---

_These templates should be customized for your specific project, technology stack, and team conventions._
