description: Idiomatic Python patterns, PEP 8 conventions, type hints, dataclasses, context managers, decorators, and best practices for building robust, maintainable Python applications. Use when the user is writing new Python code, reviewing Python code, refactoring Python, designing Python packages/modules, asks "how should I structure this in Python", asks about EAFP vs LBYL, asks about type hints/Protocol/TypeVar/TypeAlias, asks about dataclasses/NamedTuple/__slots__, asks about context managers and `with` blocks, asks about decorators or functools, asks about asyncio/threading/multiprocessing tradeoffs, or wants Python idioms and anti-patterns.

# Python Development Patterns

Idiomatic Python patterns and best practices for building robust, efficient, and maintainable applications.

## When to Activate

- Writing new Python code
- Reviewing Python code
- Refactoring existing Python code
- Designing Python packages/modules

## Critical Rules

- Prefer EAFP (try/except) over LBYL checks.
- Annotate function signatures with type hints.
- Catch specific exceptions, never bare `except`; chain with `raise ... from e`.
- Use `with` for resource management.
- No mutable default arguments; compare to `None` with `is None`.
- No `from module import *`.
- Choose the concurrency model by workload: `asyncio`, threads for I/O, processes for CPU.

## Quick Reference: Python Idioms

| Idiom               | Description                                     |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| EAFP                | Easier to Ask Forgiveness than Permission       |
| Context managers    | Use `with` for resource management              |
| List comprehensions | For simple transformations                      |
| Generators          | For lazy evaluation and large datasets          |
| Type hints          | Annotate function signatures                    |
| Dataclasses         | For data containers with auto-generated methods |
| `__slots__`         | For memory optimization                         |
| f-strings           | For string formatting (Python 3.6+)             |
| `pathlib.Path`      | For path operations (Python 3.4+)               |
| `enumerate`         | For index-element pairs in loops                |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```python
# Bad: Mutable default arguments
def append_to(item, items=[]):
    items.append(item)
    return items

# Good: Use None and create new list
def append_to(item, items=None):
    if items is None:
        items = []
    items.append(item)
    return items

# Bad: Checking type with type()
if type(obj) == list:
    process(obj)

# Good: Use isinstance
if isinstance(obj, list):
    process(obj)

# Bad: Comparing to None with ==
if value == None:
    process()

# Good: Use is
if value is None:
    process()

# Bad: from module import *
from os.path import *

# Good: Explicit imports
from os.path import join, exists

# Bad: Bare except
try:
    risky_operation()
except:
    pass

# Good: Specific exception
try:
    risky_operation()
except SpecificError as e:
    logger.error(f"Operation failed: {e}")
```

**Remember**: Python code should be readable, explicit, and follow the principle of least surprise. When in doubt, prioritize clarity over cleverness.
