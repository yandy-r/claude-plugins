description: Plan and apply fixes for findings from a code-review artifact. Parses the review file, filters by severity, dispatches review-fixer agents to apply each fix, updates Status in place (Open → Fixed/Failed), and writes a fix report. Pass --parallel for standalone sub-agent batch execution, --team (Claude Code only) for agent-team batch execution with shared TaskList and up-front dependency wiring, --severity <level> to change the threshold (default HIGH), or --dry-run to preview the plan. Pass --worktree (or use an artifact that already has a ## Worktree Setup section — auto-detected) to create one git worktree per severity level and apply fixes in isolation, with automatic fan-in merge to the parent after each severity batch validates.

# Review Fix Command

Apply fixes for findings from a code-review artifact.

**Load and follow the `ycc:review-fix` skill, passing through `$ARGUMENTS`.**

The skill parses the review file produced by `/ycc:code-review`, filters findings by severity, groups them into dependency-safe batches (same-file findings stay together, different files can run in parallel), dispatches `ycc:review-fixer` agents to apply each fix, updates the `Status` field in the source review file in place (`Open` → `Fixed` or `Failed`), and writes a fix report to `docs/prps/reviews/fixes/`.

## Input forms

| Input                     | Meaning                                                              |
| ------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `<path/to/review.md>`     | Explicit review artifact path                                        |
| `<pr-number>` (e.g. `42`) | Resolves to `docs/prps/reviews/pr-42-review.md`                      |
| blank                     | Finds the latest file in `docs/prps/reviews/` and prompts to confirm |

## Flags

- **`--parallel`** — Dispatch `ycc:review-fixer` agents as **standalone sub-agents** in parallel per batch. Level 1+2 (type-check + tests) validation runs between batches. Fail-stop with user-driven recovery via `AskUserQuestion` on validation failure. Works in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.
- **`--team`** — (Claude Code only) Same per-batch fixer fan-out as `--parallel`, but under a single `TeamCreate` with all eligible findings registered as tasks up front (`TaskCreate`) and coordinated per-batch shutdown via `SendMessage`. Provides shared task-graph observability across all batches. Cursor and Codex bundles lack team tools — use `--parallel` there. `--parallel` and `--team` are **mutually exclusive**.
- **`--severity <level>`** — Minimum severity to fix: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`. Default `HIGH` (fixes CRITICAL + HIGH, skips MEDIUM + LOW). Findings below the threshold remain `Status: Open` in the source review file.
- **`--dry-run`** — Print the fix plan (batches, files, severity distribution) and stop. No files are modified. Combine with `--team` to also preview the team name and per-batch teammate roster.
- **`--worktree`** — Create one git worktree per severity level and apply each severity's fixes inside its own child worktree, merging back to the parent after validation. Auto-detected when the review artifact contains a `## Worktree Setup` section (emitted by `/ycc:code-review --worktree`). Use the explicit flag to FORCE worktree mode on a PR artifact that lacks the section (local artifacts abort — re-run `/ycc:code-review --worktree` instead). Combines freely with `--parallel`, `--team`, `--severity`, and `--dry-run`. Cursor bundle: emits setup commands as docs (no auto-create). Codex / opencode / Claude Code: full auto-create.

## What the skill does NOT do

- Does NOT commit changes. After fixes land, run `/ycc:git-workflow` when ready.
- Does NOT re-run `/ycc:code-review`. Run it again manually to verify fixes resolved the findings.
- Does NOT retry failed fixes. Failed fixes are logged with their blocker and recommendation; the user decides how to proceed.
- Does NOT touch findings that are already `Status: Fixed` or `Status: Failed` from a prior run — this skill is resumable.

```
Usage: /ycc:review-fix [<path/to/review.md> | <pr-number> | blank] [--parallel | --team] [--severity <level>] [--worktree] [--dry-run]

Examples:
  /ycc:review-fix docs/prps/reviews/pr-42-review.md
  /ycc:review-fix 42                                           # PR #42 — resolves to pr-42-review.md
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --parallel                                # parallel sub-agent batch execution
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --team                                    # agent-team batch execution (Claude Code only)
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --severity CRITICAL                       # only fix critical findings
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --parallel --severity MEDIUM              # parallel, include medium
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --team --severity CRITICAL                # team, critical only
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --team --dry-run                          # preview team + task graph, no changes
  /ycc:review-fix docs/prps/reviews/local-20260408-143022-review.md --dry-run
  /ycc:review-fix                                              # use latest review file
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --worktree                                # severity-keyed worktrees, auto-detect from artifact
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --worktree --severity CRITICAL            # only one child worktree (critical)
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --parallel --worktree                     # parallel sub-agents per severity batch
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --team --worktree                         # agent-team per severity batch
  /ycc:review-fix 42 --worktree --dry-run                      # preview severity-keyed plan, no changes

Next steps after fixes land:
  /ycc:code-review <same target>   # re-review to verify
  /ycc:git-workflow                # commit the fixes
  git -C ~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-N push origin HEAD   # push worktree branch when --worktree was used
```
