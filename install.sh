Usage: $(basename "$0") <command> [options]

Commands:
  install     Initial setup: base step plus opt-in steps (flags below).
              $(basename "$0") install --target <targets> [--mode <mode>] [--settings] [--rules] [--mcp] [--hooks] [--only <steps>] [--project|--global] [--force]
  sync        Sync what you name, nothing else.
              $(basename "$0") sync --target <targets> --intent <intents> [--mode <mode>] [--project|--global] [--force]
  remove      Strip installer-managed config.
              $(basename "$0") remove --target <targets> (--only <steps> | --intent <intents>) [--project|--global] [--force]
  cli         Put this installer on PATH as '${CLI_NAME}'.
              $(basename "$0") cli [--dir <dir>] [--force]
  completion  Print or install shell completion.
              $(basename "$0") completion [--shell bash|zsh|fish] [--install [--force]]

A command is required; a bare '$(basename "$0") install --target ...' is rejected.

Sync plugin assets to an IDE configuration directory.

Command on PATH ('cli' / 'completion' subcommands):
  cli         Symlink this install.sh as '${CLI_NAME}' into the first of
              \$XDG_BIN_HOME, ~/.local/bin, ~/bin that is on PATH (else
              ~/.local/bin, with a warning). --dir overrides. Then run
              '${CLI_NAME} sync ...' from any project; --project targets the
              current directory's git toplevel.
  completion  Print the completion script for --shell (default: \$SHELL).
              --install symlinks it where the shell autoloads it:
                bash  \${BASH_COMPLETION_USER_DIR:-\${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/bash-completion}/completions/${CLI_NAME}
                zsh   \${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/zsh/site-functions/_${CLI_NAME}
                fish  \${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-~/.config}/fish/completions/${CLI_NAME}.fish
  Both refuse to replace an existing file or foreign symlink without --force.

  ./install.sh cli && ${CLI_NAME} completion --install

The 'sync' subcommand is the recommended entry point: say WHAT you want synced
and each target maps it onto the steps it actually supports. Structured config
files are MERGED (repo-managed keys only), so local edits, tokens, trusted
projects and CLI-written marketplace entries survive. 'install' is the
step-flag form used for first-time setup.

  $(basename "$0") sync --target claude --intent hooks,settings,mcp,plugins
  $(basename "$0") sync --target codex,claude,opencode --intent mcp
  $(basename "$0") sync --target claude --intent mods
  $(basename "$0") sync --target claude,codex --intent skills,agents

Intents (valid: base, skills, agents, commands, settings, rules, mcp, hooks,
plugins, mods):
  base      Install/register the target's whole bundle (claude/codex: the
            ycc plugin; cursor/opencode: the mirrored bundle dirs).
  skills    Standalone skills, one entry each, in the tool's own skills dir.
  agents    Standalone agents, one entry each, in the tool's own agents dir.
  commands  Standalone slash commands (claude, opencode).

  Slices (skills/agents/commands) need no plugin. Each entry is copied with
  plugin-root paths and 'ycc:' prefixes rewritten so it works on its own;
  only entries ycc installed (or identical copies) are ever replaced or
  removed, so your own skills/agents in those dirs are left alone (--force
  overrides). Destinations:
    claude    ~/.claude/{skills,agents,commands}/<name>
    cursor    ~/.cursor/{skills,agents}/<name>
    codex     ~/.codex/skills/<name> (+ _shared), ~/.codex/agents/<name>.toml
    opencode  ~/.config/opencode/{skills,agents,commands}/<name> (+ shared/)
  settings  Merge repo-managed config keys (models, effort levels, ...).
  rules     Symlink the shared CLAUDE.md / AGENTS.md ruleset.
  mcp       Merge MCP server definitions.
  hooks     Merge hook config; claude also links the hook scripts directory.
  plugins   Merge plugin enablement and marketplace entries. Add 'base' too
            when you also want the target's CLI to perform registration.
  mods      Install the Claude Code mods under ycc/mods (claude only for now).

  Intents a target cannot execute are reported and skipped. 'sync' is exclusive:
  it never implicitly runs 'base'.

  Intent → step mapping per target:
    claude    base→base  settings→settings  rules→rules  mcp→mcp
              hooks→settings+hooks  plugins→settings  mods→mods
              skills→skills  agents→agents  commands→commands
    cursor    base→base  skills→skills  agents→agents  settings→settings
              rules→rules  mcp→mcp
              commands, hooks, plugins, mods → no-op
    codex     base→base  skills→skills  agents→agents  settings→settings
              rules→rules  mcp→mcp  plugins → settings (config.toml)
              commands, hooks, mods → no-op
    opencode  base→base  skills→skills  agents→agents  commands→commands
              settings→settings  rules→rules  mcp→mcp
              plugins → settings (opencode.json)  hooks, mods → no-op

Remove ('remove' subcommand):
  Undoes what the selected steps installed, for every target and intent (same
  intent → step mapping as 'sync'). Requires --only or --intent; rejects
  --mode. Only installer-owned things go:
    settings/plugins/hooks/mcp  managed config keys; keys you added are never
                                touched, a managed value you edited is kept
                                with a warning unless --force. A config file
                                left empty is deleted.
    rules, claude hooks dir     symlinks, only while they still point here.
    claude statusline script    only while identical to the repo (or --force).
    base                        claude: 'claude plugin uninstall ycc@ycc' +
                                marketplace remove; cursor/opencode: the
                                bundle entries from the synced dirs; codex:
                                plugin links, plugin cache, custom agents
                                and the marketplace.json entry.
    skills / agents / commands  the standalone entries ycc installed (or
                                that are still identical to the bundle);
                                never the plugin, never your own entries.
    mods (claude)               uninstall each mod + the ycc-mods marketplace.

  $(basename "$0") remove --target claude --only mcp            # project scope
  $(basename "$0") remove --target all --intent mcp --global    # user-global
  $(basename "$0") remove --target codex --intent settings,rules
  $(basename "$0") remove --target all --intent base,settings,rules,hooks,plugins,mods
  $(basename "$0") remove --target opencode --intent agents,commands

Scope (--project | --global, mutually exclusive):
  Without a flag, steps that support project scope use it; all others stay
  global. --project with a step lacking project support is an error. The
  project is the git toplevel of the current directory (else the directory).
  Project-capable steps today: mcp.

    target    mcp --project                   mcp --global
    claude    <project>/.mcp.json             ~/.claude.json
    cursor    <project>/.cursor/mcp.json      ~/.cursor/mcp.json
    codex     <project>/.codex/config.toml    ~/.codex/config.toml
              (Codex loads it only for trusted projects)
    opencode  <project>/opencode.json         ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json

Merge semantics (all structured config files):
  - Keys this repo declares as managed are written; every other key is kept.
  - A managed value the installer previously wrote is updated automatically.
  - A managed value YOU changed is preserved, with a warning; --force takes
    the repo value instead.
  - Ownership is tracked by hash in ~/.config/ycc/managed-config-state.json
    (hashes only — never values).

Options:
  --target <targets>  Comma-separated targets: claude, cursor, codex, opencode,
                      or all (which must stand alone). Every target is
                      validated before any of them runs.
  --mode <mode>       Marketplace source mode (default: local). Supported:
                        local — register the local repo checkout as the
                                marketplace source. claude target adds the
                                local path as a directory marketplace; codex
                                target symlinks .codex-plugin/ycc/ into
                                ~/.codex/plugins/ycc/ and
                                ~/.agents/plugins/ycc, writes a {source:
                                local, path: ./.agents/plugins/ycc}
                                marketplace entry, then runs 'codex plugin
                                add'. cursor/opencode rsync the bundles.
                        repo  — register the upstream github repo
                                yandy-r/claude-plugins as the marketplace
                                source. claude target adds the github slug
                                via the CLI; codex target writes a
                                {source: github, repo: yandy-r/claude-plugins,
                                ref: main} marketplace entry and skips
                                local generation/symlink/agents-sync.
                                cursor and opencode REJECT --mode repo
                                (they have no remote-source concept).
                                With --target all + --mode repo, cursor and
                                opencode are skipped with a warning.
  --settings          Additive: MERGE repo-managed keys into per-machine config
                      files while preserving local model choices, tokens,
                      marketplace entries written by the CLI, trusted-project
                      lists, and unknown keys. Managed values changed locally
                      are preserved unless --force is passed. Non-structured
                      companion files (for example the Claude statusline script)
                      still use copy semantics.
                      Mode-agnostic. Scope per target:
                        claude   — settings.json, statusline-command.sh
                        codex    — config.toml
                        opencode — opencode.json
                        cursor   — cli-config.json (CLI model preference)
  --rules             Additive: SYMLINK rules files so edits flow across
                      systems (this is the old --settings behavior for rules).
                      Refuses to replace a real rules file without --force;
                      replaces existing symlinks idempotently. Mode-agnostic.
                      Scope per target:
                        claude   — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md at ~/.claude/
                        cursor   — CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md at ~/.cursor/
                        codex    — default.rules, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md at ~/.codex/
                        opencode — AGENTS.md at ~/.config/opencode/
  --mcp               Additive: also run the target's 'mcp' step. Mode-agnostic.
                      Scope follows --project (default) / --global.
  --project           Scope-capable steps (today: mcp) write into the current
                      project. Default when neither flag is given.
  --global            Scope-capable steps write into user-global config.
  --hooks             Additive: also run the target's 'hooks' step.
                      Currently supported by the claude target only; silently
                      ignored by targets without hook support. Mode-agnostic.
  --force             Let repo-managed config values win over local edits, and
                      replace real rules files with repo symlinks when needed.
                      Unknown/unmanaged config keys are never removed.
  --only <steps>      Exclusive: run only the comma-separated steps
                      (e.g. --only settings, --only rules,settings).
                      Overrides defaults and --settings/--rules/--mcp/--hooks.
                      A skills/agents/commands step a target has no home for
                      is skipped with a notice (e.g. commands on cursor).
  --intent <intents>  'sync' / 'remove' subcommands only. Comma-separated intents (see
                      above). Cannot be combined with --only or the additive
                      --settings/--rules/--mcp/--hooks flags.
  --help              Show this help message

install semantics:
  Default (no --only):
    - Run the target's 'base' step (if any).
    - Additionally run 'settings' / 'rules' / 'mcp' / 'hooks' if their flag is
      passed.
  With --only <steps>:
    - Run exactly the listed steps. Nothing else.

  Transport semantics:
    - --settings (copy)   dest absent: cp; dest is a symlink: warn + rm + cp;
                          dest is a real file: error unless --force.
    - --rules    (symlink) idempotent link; refuses to replace a real file
                          without --force.

Target steps:
  claude    base | skills | agents | commands | settings | rules | mcp | hooks | mods
            base:     invoke 'claude plugin marketplace add <repo> --scope user'
                      + 'claude plugin install ycc@ycc --scope user'. Breaks
                      ~/.claude/settings.json symlink (if any) first so the CLI
                      write doesn't pollute the committed source file. Edits
                      in ycc/ apply on /reload-plugins.
            settings: MERGE managed keys from ycc/settings/settings.json into
                      ~/.claude/settings.json and COPY statusline-command.sh.
                      Local edits and CLI-written marketplace entries are
                      preserved unless --force resolves a managed conflict.
            rules:    symlink ycc/settings/rules/{CLAUDE.md,AGENTS.md} into
                      ~/.claude/.
            mcp:      merge mcp-configs/mcp.json mcpServers into <project>/.mcp.json
                      (--project, default) or ~/.claude.json (--global).
            hooks:    symlink ycc/settings/hooks/ into ~/.claude/hooks/, enabling
                      the WorktreeCreate hook (redirects harness-managed
                      worktrees to ~/.claude-worktrees/).
            mods:     'claude plugin marketplace add ycc/mods --scope user'
                      (the local 'ycc-mods' marketplace) + 'claude plugin
                      install <mod>@ycc-mods --scope user' for each mod it
                      lists. Mods load in place; edits apply on /reload-plugins.
            skills / agents / commands:
                      copy ycc/{skills,agents,commands} entries into
                      ~/.claude/<slice>/ (paths re-pointed, 'ycc:' dropped).
                      With the ycc plugin also installed they appear twice.
  cursor    base | skills | agents | settings | mcp | rules
            base:     generate + validate + format + rsync bundle to ~/.cursor/.
            skills:   generate + install each skill into ~/.cursor/skills/.
            agents:   generate + install each agent into ~/.cursor/agents/.
            settings: merge .cursor-plugin/config/cli-config.json into
                      ~/.cursor/cli-config.json (main CLI model preference).
            mcp:      merge mcp-configs/mcp.json mcpServers into
                      <project>/.cursor/mcp.json or ~/.cursor/mcp.json.
            rules:    symlink ycc/settings/rules/{CLAUDE.md,AGENTS.md} into
                      ~/.cursor/ (top level — NOT inside ~/.cursor/rules/, which
                      is rsynced with --delete during 'base').
                      Cursor sub-agent models are set per generated agent file
                      in .cursor-plugin/agents/, not in cli-config.json.
  codex     base | skills | agents | settings | rules | mcp
            base:     generate + validate + format + sync custom agents, then
                      register the repo's .codex-plugin/ycc/ as a local
                      marketplace source in ~/.agents/plugins/marketplace.json
                      via ~/.agents/plugins/ycc -> .codex-plugin/ycc/, then
                      installs + enables it with 'codex plugin add
                      ycc@local-ycc-plugins' (Codex 0.160+; older builds get
                      the legacy hand-written cache).
                      Rerun this step after ./scripts/sync.sh --only codex to
                      refresh Codex's snapshot of the plugin.
            skills:   generate + install each skill into ~/.codex/skills/
                      (shared helpers at ~/.codex/skills/_shared). No plugin
                      link, cache or marketplace entry.
            agents:   generate + install each custom agent into ~/.codex/agents/.
            settings: MERGE managed keys from .codex-plugin/config/config.toml
                      into ~/.codex/config.toml. Comments, trusted projects,
                      MCP bearer tokens, connector entries and unknown tables
                      are preserved; the 'plugins' intent maps here too.
            mcp:      merge [mcp_servers.*] from .codex-plugin/config/config.toml
                      into <project>/.codex/config.toml or ~/.codex/config.toml.
            rules:    symlink .codex-plugin/config/default.rules AND
                      ycc/settings/rules/{CLAUDE.md,AGENTS.md} into ~/.codex/.
  opencode  base | skills | agents | commands | settings | rules | mcp
