# Install: `~/.agents` (cross-tool skills)

The `agents` target installs the ycc **skills only** into `~/.agents/skills/`, the
shared user skill directory read by Zed, Codex, opencode, Cursor, Gemini CLI,
VS Code/Copilot, Amp, Goose, and Windsurf. Claude Code does **not** read it; use
the `claude` target for Claude Code.

```bash
./install.sh install --target agents
./install.sh remove  --target agents --only skills
```

Layout:

| Path                       | Contents                                           |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `~/.agents/skills/<name>/` | one directory per ycc skill (flat, agentskills.io) |
| `~/.agents/ycc-shared/`    | shared helper scripts/references the skills call   |

The bundle is generated from `ycc/skills/` into `.agents-plugin/`
(`./scripts/sync.sh --only agents`). Only entries ycc installed are replaced or
removed; your own skills in `~/.agents/skills/` and Codex's `~/.agents/plugins/`
are never touched.

## Commands, agents, rules

No tool reads `~/.agents/commands`, `~/.agents/agents`, or `~/.agents/AGENTS.md`,
so this target ships none of them. Install those per tool (`--target opencode`,
`--target codex`, ...).

## Duplicate skills

Every supported tool that reads `~/.agents/skills` (today: Codex, opencode,
Cursor) also reads its own skill directory. Installing ycc skills natively for
two or more of them, or for one of them alongside `agents`, lists every skill
twice. The installer detects this for any such target:

```bash
./install.sh install --target claude,codex,opencode --only base
# warning: codex and opencode will produce duplicate ycc skills ...
#   [1] Recommended — skills → ~/.agents/skills; codex and opencode get only their non-skill pieces natively  (default)
#   [2] Keep as requested (native skills per tool; duplicates possible)
#   [3] Abort
```

The prompt appears only on a terminal. Answer it in advance with
`--skills-home agents` (option 1) or `--skills-home native` (option 2). Without a
terminal or the flag, the installer warns and continues as requested.

Option 1 per target:

- opencode: installs `agents/` and `commands/` only (no `skills/`, `shared/`).
- cursor: installs `agents/` only.
- codex: installs standalone agents in `~/.codex/agents/` instead of registering
  the plugin (the plugin carries the skills).
- settings, rules, MCP, and hooks are unchanged.

## Adding a target

Each `scripts/lib/install/targets/<t>.sh` declares `<t>_reads_agents_skills`
(return 0 if the tool reads `~/.agents/skills`). Targets that return 0 must also
declare `<t>_native_skills_dirs` and pass their skill units through
`skills_filter <t>` so option 1 can drop them. The install tests fail if a
target omits the declaration.
