# Feature Issue Template

Use this template for individual feature/deliverable issues created from research output.

## Template

```markdown
## Summary

{feature_summary}

## User Story

{user_story}

## Acceptance Criteria

{acceptance_criteria}

## Technical Details

- **Complexity**: {complexity}
- **Dependencies**: {dependencies}
- **Confidence**: {confidence_level} ({confidence_detail})

## Research Context

> Extracted from: {source_document}
> Research date: {research_date}

{additional_context}
```

## Field Descriptions

| Field | Source | Example |
|-------|--------|---------|
| feature_summary | Synthesized from feature description | "Implement encrypted credential storage..." |
| user_story | Strategic recommendations feature table | "As a network engineer, I can store..." |
| acceptance_criteria | Strategic recommendations acceptance criteria | Numbered list |
| complexity | Strategic recommendations complexity | "Large", "Medium", "Small" |
| dependencies | Strategic recommendations dependencies | "Multi-tenant data model, auth system" |
| confidence_level | Convergence analysis confidence | "High", "Medium-High", "Medium" |
| confidence_detail | Personas supporting | "8/8 personas", "5/8 personas" |
| source_document | File the feature was extracted from | "synthesis/strategic-recommendations.md" |
| research_date | RESEARCH-REPORT.md date field | "2026-03-09" |
| additional_context | Relevant notes from other research docs | Architecture notes, risk notes |

## Label Assignment Rules

### Priority Labels (from confidence)

| Confidence | Label |
|-----------|-------|
| High (7-8 personas or explicitly "High") | `priority:high` |
| Medium-High (5-6 personas) | `priority:medium` |
| Medium or lower | `priority:low` + `under-review` |

### Feature Labels

Format: `feat:{feature-name-kebab-case}`

Examples:
- `feat:multi-tenant-data-model`
- `feat:credential-vault`
- `feat:snmp-discovery`
- `feat:topology-visualization`

### Status Labels

| Condition | Label |
|-----------|-------|
| Anti-scope item (explicitly deferred) | `under-review`, `deferred` |
| Research gap (needs more investigation) | `under-review`, `research-gap` |
| Low/medium confidence | `under-review` |
| High confidence, in-scope | (no extra status label) |

### Phase Labels

All feature issues also receive `phase:{N}` matching their tracking issue.

## Issue for Anti-Scope Items

Anti-scope items use a simplified template:

```markdown
## Summary

{anti_scope_description}

## Why Deferred

{reason_for_deferral}

## When to Revisit

{when_to_build}

## Research Context

> Extracted from: {source_document} (Anti-Scope)
> Research date: {research_date}
```

## Issue for Research Gaps

Research gap items use a simplified template:

```markdown
## Summary

{gap_description}

## Gap Severity

{severity}

## What Was Missed

{what_was_missed}

## What Needs Further Research

{research_needed}

## Research Context

> Extracted from: {source_document} (Research Gaps)
> Research date: {research_date}
```
