description: Dual-mode code review — local uncommitted changes OR a GitHub pull request. Both modes now write a machine-parseable review artifact (Local → docs/prps/reviews/local-{timestamp}-review.md, PR → docs/prps/reviews/pr-{N}-review.md) with sequential finding IDs (F001, F002, ...) and Status fields (Open/Fixed/Failed) so /review-fix can consume and update them in place. Local mode runs a full security + quality pass on the diff. PR mode fetches the PR, reads each changed file in full, builds context from CLAUDE.md and PRP artifacts, applies a 7-category review checklist, runs validation commands (type-check/lint/test/build) for detected stacks, assigns severity, and posts the review to GitHub via gh. Pass `--parallel` to fan out the REVIEW phase across 3 standalone code-reviewer sub-agents (correctness, security, quality) and merge findings. Pass `--team` (Claude Code only) to run the same 3-reviewer fan-out as a coordinated agent team with shared TaskList, per-reviewer task tracking, and inter-reviewer communication via SendMessage. `--parallel` and `--team` are mutually exclusive. Worktree mode is on by default in PR mode — pass `--no-worktree` to opt out. Pass `--keep-draft` to skip automatic draft→ready promotion. Pass `--keep-worktree` to skip worktree removal after the review is posted. Use when the user asks to "review code", "review PR", "check uncommitted changes", "review pr N", "parallel review", "team review", or says "/code-review". Adapted from PRPs-agentic-eng by Wirasm.

# Code Review

> PR review mode adapted from PRPs-agentic-eng by Wirasm. Part of the PRP workflow series.

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS`

## Flag Parsing

Before selecting mode, extract flags from `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Flag                | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--approve`         | Force the final decision to APPROVE regardless of findings (still reports all findings)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `--request-changes` | Force the final decision to REQUEST CHANGES regardless of findings                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--parallel`        | Fan out the REVIEW phase across 3 **standalone** `code-reviewer` sub-agents (correctness, security, quality) dispatched in parallel and merge findings. Works in Claude Code, Cursor, and Codex.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `--team`            | (Claude Code only) Fan out the REVIEW phase across the same 3 `code-reviewer` reviewers, but dispatched as an **agent team** with up-front `TaskCreate`, shared `TaskList` observability, inter-reviewer coordination via `SendMessage`, and coordinated shutdown before merge. Heavier dispatch, richer communication.                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--worktree`        | (legacy / now default; safe to omit) Check out the PR head branch into an isolated worktree at `~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>/`. Worktree mode is on by default in PR mode; pass `--no-worktree` to opt out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `--no-worktree`     | Opt out of worktree isolation in PR mode. Skip worktree creation, artifact commit+push, and cleanup. Files are read directly from the main checkout.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `--keep-draft`      | Skip the automatic draft→ready promotion in PR mode. Default: PR is promoted to Ready for Review before posting the review.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `--keep-worktree`   | Skip removal of the PR worktree after the review is posted. The artifact is still committed and pushed to the PR branch. Default: worktree is removed via `git worktree remove <path>` after a clean review post.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `--quick`           | Fast on-the-fly review of uncommitted changes. Skips worktree setup, toolchain validation (typecheck/lint/test/build), and GitHub publish. Writes a minimal artifact to `docs/prps/reviews/quick-{timestamp}-review.md` and ends with a `Next steps:` block recommending `/review-fix` (single-pass) or `/review-fix --parallel` (fan-out). Compatible with `--parallel` and `--team`. Mutually exclusive with a PR argument, `--approve`, and `--request-changes`. |

Strip these from `$ARGUMENTS` and set `QUICK_MODE=true|false`, `PARALLEL_MODE=true|false`, `AGENT_TEAM_MODE=true|false`, `NO_WORKTREE_MODE=true|false`, `KEEP_DRAFT=true|false`, and `KEEP_WORKTREE=true|false`. Compute `WORKTREE_MODE=true` unless `--no-worktree` is present (default-on in PR mode; ignored for local mode as before). The remaining text is the mode selector (PR number/URL or blank for local).

**Validation**:

- `--parallel` and `--team` are **mutually exclusive**. If both are passed → abort with: `--parallel and --team are mutually exclusive. Pick one.`
- If `--team` is set during a bundle invocation (Cursor/Codex), abort with: `--team is not supported in bundle invocations; use --parallel instead.`
- `--quick` with a PR number/URL is **not allowed**. If both are passed → abort with: `--quick only reviews uncommitted local changes; remove the PR argument or drop --quick.`
- `--quick` with `--approve` or `--request-changes` is **not allowed**. Quick mode does not publish a GitHub review, so these flags have no meaning. Abort with: `--approve / --request-changes have no meaning in quick mode (no GitHub review is posted). Drop the flag or use PR mode.`
- `--quick` with `--no-worktree`, `--keep-draft`, or `--keep-worktree` is accepted as a **no-op** (quick mode never creates a worktree or touches GitHub). Emit a note: `<flag> has no effect in quick mode.`
- `--quick` with `--parallel` or `--team` is **allowed**. Quick mode honors the 3-reviewer fan-out for its REVIEW phase. `--team` still requires Claude Code (same compatibility gate as today).

**Compatibility note**: When this skill is invoked from a Cursor or Codex bundle, `--team` must not be used (those bundles ship without team tools — `TeamCreate`, `SendMessage`, etc.). Use `--parallel` instead.

Parallel mode and team mode both apply to **both** Local Review Mode (Phase 2) and PR Review Mode (Phase 3). All other phases are unchanged.

---

## Phase 0½ — SETUP (PR mode default; skipped with `--no-worktree`)

Skip this phase entirely when `WORKTREE_MODE=false` (i.e., `--no-worktree` was passed).

### Local mode with `--worktree`

Uncommitted changes cannot be branch-isolated in a worktree. Emit:

```
Note: --worktree has no effect in local mode; uncommitted changes are not branch-isolated.
```

Continue with Local Review Mode but set `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=false`. **Do NOT** emit a `## Worktree Setup` section in the artifact.

### PR mode with `--worktree`

1. Resolve `<repo>`:

   ```bash
   REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
   ```

2. Resolve `<pr-head-branch>`:

   ```bash
   PR_HEAD=$(gh pr view <N> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
   ```

3. Compute slug = `pr-<N>`.

4. Check out the PR head branch into an isolated worktree:

   ```bash
   PARENT_WORKTREE_PATH=$(
     bash "${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/scripts/setup-worktree.sh" \
       parent "${REPO}" "pr-<N>" --base-ref "${PR_HEAD}"
   )
   ```

   The script is idempotent: re-running it on an existing worktree on the same branch reuses the path.

5. Record `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`, `PARENT_BRANCH=<PR_HEAD>`, and `PARENT_WORKTREE_PATH=<captured path>`.

6. If the checkout fails (e.g., the branch is already checked out in the main repo or conflicts exist), abort with:

   ```
   Error: could not check out PR head '<PR_HEAD>' into a worktree.
   Likely cause: the branch is currently checked out in the main repository.
   Switch away from it (git switch <other-branch>) and re-run.
   ```

### Behavior summary

| Flag state                              | Effect                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `WORKTREE_MODE=false` (`--no-worktree`) | No worktree. Files read from main working tree (local) or GitHub API (PR). |
| `WORKTREE_MODE=true` (default), local   | Warning printed; no worktree created; behaves as `WORKTREE_MODE=false`.    |
| `WORKTREE_MODE=true` (default), PR      | Parent worktree created; files read from `$PARENT_WORKTREE_PATH`.          |

Proceed to Mode Selection.

---

## Mode Selection

- If `QUICK_MODE=true` → **Quick Review Mode** below. (Validation in Phase 0 already rejected any combination that would be ambiguous, so we know the user wants an uncommitted-diff-only pass.)
- If a PR number/URL was provided → **PR Review Mode** below.
- Otherwise → **Local Review Mode** below.

---

## Local Review Mode

Comprehensive security and quality review of uncommitted changes.

### Phase 1 — GATHER

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

If no changed files, stop: "Nothing to review."

### Phase 2 — REVIEW

The shape of this phase depends on `PARALLEL_MODE` and `AGENT_TEAM_MODE`:

| Flags             | Path                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Neither set       | **Path A** — single-pass review (default)   |
| `PARALLEL_MODE`   | **Path B** — 3 parallel sub-agent reviewers |
| `AGENT_TEAM_MODE` | **Path C** — 3-reviewer agent team          |

#### Path A — Single-Pass Review (default, neither flag set)

Read each changed file in full. Check for:

**Security Issues (CRITICAL):**

- Hardcoded credentials, API keys, tokens
- SQL injection vulnerabilities
- XSS vulnerabilities
- Missing input validation
- Insecure dependencies
- Path traversal risks

**Code Quality (HIGH):**

- Functions > 50 lines
- Files > 800 lines
- Nesting depth > 4 levels
- Missing error handling
- `console.log` statements
- TODO/FIXME comments
- Missing JSDoc for public APIs

**Best Practices (MEDIUM):**

- Mutation patterns (use immutable instead)
- Emoji usage in code/comments
- Missing tests for new code
- Accessibility issues (a11y)

#### Path B — Parallel Sub-Agent Review (`PARALLEL_MODE=true`)

Dispatch **3 standalone `code-reviewer` sub-agents in parallel** in a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE `Agent` tool calls. Each agent reads all changed files and applies its assigned focus:

| Reviewer               | Focus           | Checklist Items                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `correctness-reviewer` | Code Quality    | Functions > 50 lines, files > 800 lines, nesting > 4 levels, missing error handling, `console.log`, TODO/FIXME, missing JSDoc |
| `security-reviewer`    | Security Issues | Hardcoded credentials/keys/tokens, SQL injection, XSS, missing input validation, insecure deps, path traversal                |
| `quality-reviewer`     | Best Practices  | Mutation patterns, emoji in code/comments, missing tests, accessibility (a11y)                                                |

Each reviewer prompt must include:

1. The list of changed files (`git diff --name-only HEAD`)
2. Its assigned focus and checklist items (from the table above)
3. The severity rubric (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
4. A directive to return findings in the standard format below

Each reviewer returns findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### CRITICAL

- `file.ts:42` — [description]
  - Suggested fix: [fix]

### HIGH

- ...

### MEDIUM

- ...

### LOW

- ...
```

After all 3 reviewers return, **merge findings**:

1. Combine by severity (CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
2. De-duplicate findings at the same `file:line` (if two reviewers flagged the same issue, keep the more severe one and annotate which reviewers concurred)
3. Sort within each severity by file path
4. Attach the reviewer source to each finding (`[correctness]`, `[security]`, `[quality]`) for traceability

Pass the merged findings to Phase 3 (REPORT) as if they came from a single-pass review.

#### Path C — Agent Team Review (`AGENT_TEAM_MODE=true`, Claude Code only)

> **MANDATORY — AGENT TEAMS REQUIRED**
>
> In Path C you MUST follow the agent-team lifecycle. Do NOT mix standalone sub-agents
> with team dispatch. Every `Agent` call below MUST include `team_name=` AND `name=`.
>
> 1. `TeamCreate` once at the start
> 2. `TaskCreate` for all 3 reviewer subtasks up front (flat graph — no dependencies)
> 3. Spawn 3 teammates: single message, three `Agent` calls with `team_name=` + `name=`
> 4. `TaskList` to monitor until all reviewers mark complete
> 5. `SendMessage({type:"shutdown_request"})` to all 3 teammates
> 6. `TeamDelete` before merging
>
> If `TeamCreate` or `TaskCreate` fails, abort the skill. Refer to
> `${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/references/agent-team-dispatch.md`
> for the full lifecycle contract.

Same 3-reviewer roster as Path B, but dispatched as a coordinated team with a shared task list. Use this when reviewers may surface overlapping findings (e.g., a security hole that's also a correctness bug) and you want them to cross-reference each other via `SendMessage` during review.

##### C.1 Build the team name

Team name: `crev-local-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>`. Use the same timestamp you will use later when writing the review artifact so the team name and the output filename share a traceable identifier.

##### C.2 Create the team

```
TeamCreate: team_name="crev-local-<timestamp>", description="Code review team for uncommitted local changes"
```

On failure, abort.

##### C.3 Register subtasks

Create 3 tasks in the shared task list (flat graph — reviewers are independent):

```
TaskCreate: subject="correctness-reviewer: code-quality review of uncommitted changes", description="<full reviewer prompt>"
TaskCreate: subject="security-reviewer: security review of uncommitted changes",        description="<full reviewer prompt>"
TaskCreate: subject="quality-reviewer: best-practices review of uncommitted changes",   description="<full reviewer prompt>"
```

If any `TaskCreate` fails → `TeamDelete`, then abort.

##### C.4 Spawn the 3 reviewers (single message, three Agent calls)

Dispatch all three teammates in **ONE message** with **THREE `Agent` tool calls**. Every call MUST include:

- `team_name`: `"crev-local-<timestamp>"`
- `name`: the reviewer name (`correctness-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `quality-reviewer`) — must match the `TaskCreate` subject prefix
- `subagent_type`: `"code-reviewer"`
- `description`: One-line task title (e.g., `"Code-quality review of local changes"`)
- `prompt`: The same reviewer prompt used in Path B (changed files, focus + checklist items, severity rubric, expected findings format) PLUS a note that the teammate shares a task list with two sibling reviewers (name them) and may `SendMessage` them if it discovers a finding that overlaps their scope, and must call `TaskUpdate` to mark its task complete before returning.

##### C.5 Monitor and collect results

Use `TaskList` to confirm all 3 tasks are `completed` before merging. If a teammate messages the orchestrator, respond via `SendMessage`. Failure policy:

- All 3 error → `TeamDelete`, abort with a clear error.
- 1 or 2 error → record "partial review — {role} did not complete" and proceed with the remaining reviewers' findings. Note the gap in the Phase 3 artifact Summary.

##### C.6 Shutdown and cleanup

After all teammates have marked their tasks complete (or been recorded as failed):

```
SendMessage(to="correctness-reviewer", message={type:"shutdown_request"})
SendMessage(to="security-reviewer",    message={type:"shutdown_request"})
SendMessage(to="quality-reviewer",     message={type:"shutdown_request"})
TeamDelete
```

Always `TeamDelete` — even on abort or partial failure.

##### C.7 Merge findings

Apply the same merge procedure as Path B (combine by severity, de-dupe at `file:line`, sort by file path, attach reviewer source tags). Pass the merged findings to Phase 3 (REPORT).

### Phase 3 — REPORT

Assign a sequential finding ID to each issue (`F001`, `F002`, `F003`, ...) ordered by severity (CRITICAL first) then by file path. Every finding receives `Status: Open` on first write.

Generate the review artifact and write it to `docs/prps/reviews/local-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-review.md`:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/prps/reviews
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
REVIEW_FILE="docs/prps/reviews/local-${TIMESTAMP}-review.md"
```

Use the **Review Artifact Format** defined at the bottom of this skill. Include:

- Finding ID (`**[F001]**`)
- Severity bucket (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
- `Status: Open` (always on first write)
- Category tag
- `file:line` reference
- Description
- Suggested fix

**Always write the file**, even if there are no findings (empty sections are acceptable — they give `/review-fix` a consistent target and preserve history).

Print a concise summary to stdout with the file path and a hint to run fixes:

```
Local review written to: docs/prps/reviews/local-20260408-143022-review.md
Findings: [C] 2  [H] 3  [M] 1  [L] 0

## Quick Review Mode

> Triggered by `--quick`. Lightweight review of uncommitted changes — no worktree, no toolchain validation, no GitHub publish. Just findings plus a `Next steps:` block offering `/review-fix`. Writes a minimal artifact to `docs/prps/reviews/quick-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-review.md` so `/review-fix` can consume it unchanged.

### Phase 1 — GATHER

Identical to Local Review Mode Phase 1 (line 151 above). Compute changed files with:

```bash
git diff --name-only HEAD
```

If the diff is empty, print `Nothing to review.` and exit. Do NOT write an artifact.

### Phase 2 — REVIEW

Delegate to **Local Review Mode Phase 2** (starting at line 159 above). The same 7-category checklist, severity rubric, Path A (single-pass) / Path B (`--parallel` → 3 standalone sub-agent reviewers) / Path C (`--team` → coordinated agent team) all apply unchanged.

- If `--parallel` → Path B fan-out.
- If `--team` → Path C (Claude Code only; compatibility gate already enforced in Phase 0).
- Otherwise → Path A.

When using Path C in quick mode, use team name `qrev-local-<YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS>` (matching the artifact timestamp). Lifecycle is identical to Local Mode Path C: TeamCreate → TaskCreate × 3 → Agent × 3 in one message → monitor via TaskList → merge → SendMessage shutdown → TeamDelete.

### Phase 3 — REPORT

Assign sequential finding IDs (F001, F002, …) with `Status: Open` on every finding. Write the artifact to `docs/prps/reviews/quick-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-review.md`. The artifact uses the **Review Artifact Format** (defined at the bottom of this skill) with two omissions:

- **No** `## Validation Results` section — quick mode does not run toolchain validation.
- **No** `## Worktree Setup` section — quick mode never creates a worktree.

All other sections (Header, Summary, Findings with full ID/Status/Category/Suggested fix, Files Reviewed) are identical to Local Mode's output. `/review-fix` parses the result unchanged.

Then print a `Next steps:` block to stdout:

```
Quick review written to: docs/prps/reviews/quick-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-review.md
Findings: [C] {critical_count}  [H] {high_count}  [M] {medium_count}  [L] {low_count}

Next steps:
  /review-fix docs/prps/reviews/quick-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-review.md              # apply fixes {recommended_single if 1-2 Open findings}
  /review-fix docs/prps/reviews/quick-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS-review.md --parallel   # fan out fixes {recommended_parallel if 3+ Open across 2+ files}
```

**Recommendation heuristic** (annotate ONE of the two commands with `# ← recommended`):

- 0 Open findings → print `No findings. No follow-up needed.` and skip the two `/review-fix` command lines.
- 1–2 Open findings → recommend the single-pass form.
- 3+ Open findings spanning 2+ files → recommend the `--parallel` form.

Quick mode has **NO** Phase 4/5/6/7/8 — no VALIDATE, DECIDE, PUBLISH, or OUTPUT phases. If you need toolchain validation or a GitHub review posted, re-run without `--quick`.

---

## PR Review Mode

Comprehensive GitHub PR review — fetches diff, reads full files, runs validation, posts review.

Detect whether GitHub MCP tools are available (look for `mcp__github__*`). If they are, prefer those for PR fetch/view/review operations. Otherwise fall back to the `gh` CLI examples shown below.

### Phase 1 — FETCH

Parse input to determine PR:

| Input                          | Action                                   |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------- |
| Number (e.g. `42`)             | Use as PR number                         |
| URL (`github.com/.../pull/42`) | Extract PR number                        |
| Branch name                    | Find PR via `gh pr list --head <branch>` |

```bash
gh pr view <NUMBER> --json number,title,body,author,baseRefName,headRefName,changedFiles,additions,deletions
gh pr diff <NUMBER>
```

If PR not found, stop with error. Store PR metadata for later phases.

### Phase 2 — CONTEXT

Build review context:

1. **Project rules** — Read `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/docs/`, and any contributing guidelines
2. **PRP artifacts** — Check `docs/prps/reports/` and `docs/prps/plans/` (including `completed/`) for implementation context related to this PR
3. **PR intent** — Parse PR description for goals, linked issues, test plans
4. **Changed files** — List all modified files and categorize by type (source, test, config, docs)

### Phase 3 — REVIEW

Read each changed file **in full** (not just the diff hunks — you need surrounding context).

For PR reviews, fetch the full file contents at the PR head revision:

**When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`**: read files directly from the parent worktree using the `Read` tool — the worktree has the PR head branch checked out, so the files on disk match the PR head revision. Skip the `gh api` fetch entirely:

```bash
# Instead of: gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/$file?ref=<head-branch>"
# Read from:  ${PARENT_WORKTREE_PATH}/$file
```

**When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=false`** (the existing path): continue to use `gh api` to fetch each file at the PR head ref:

```bash
gh pr diff <NUMBER> --name-only | while IFS= read -r file; do
  gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/$file?ref=<head-branch>" --jq '.content' | base64 -d
done
```

The shape of this phase depends on `PARALLEL_MODE` and `AGENT_TEAM_MODE`:

| Flags             | Path                                        |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Neither set       | **Path A** — single-pass review (default)   |
| `PARALLEL_MODE`   | **Path B** — 3 parallel sub-agent reviewers |
| `AGENT_TEAM_MODE` | **Path C** — 3-reviewer agent team          |

#### Path A — Single-Pass Review (default, neither flag set)

Apply the review checklist across 7 categories:

| Category               | What to Check                                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Correctness**        | Logic errors, off-by-ones, null handling, edge cases, race conditions         |
| **Type Safety**        | Type mismatches, unsafe casts, `any` usage, missing generics                  |
| **Pattern Compliance** | Matches project conventions (naming, file structure, error handling, imports) |
| **Security**           | Injection, auth gaps, secret exposure, SSRF, path traversal, XSS              |
| **Performance**        | N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded loops, memory leaks, large payloads   |
| **Completeness**       | Missing tests, missing error handling, incomplete migrations, missing docs    |
| **Maintainability**    | Dead code, magic numbers, deep nesting, unclear naming, missing types         |

#### Path B — Parallel Sub-Agent Review (`PARALLEL_MODE=true`)

Dispatch **3 standalone `code-reviewer` sub-agents in parallel** in a SINGLE message with MULTIPLE `Agent` tool calls. Each agent reads all changed files at the PR head revision and applies its assigned category slice:

| Reviewer               | Categories                             | What to Check                                                                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `correctness-reviewer` | Correctness, Type Safety, Completeness | Logic errors, off-by-ones, null handling, edge cases, race conditions, type mismatches, unsafe casts, `any` usage, missing generics, missing tests, incomplete migrations |
| `security-reviewer`    | Security, Performance                  | Injection, auth gaps, secret exposure, SSRF, path traversal, XSS, N+1 queries, missing indexes, unbounded loops, memory leaks, large payloads                             |
| `quality-reviewer`     | Pattern Compliance, Maintainability    | Project conventions (naming, file structure, error handling, imports), dead code, magic numbers, deep nesting, unclear naming, missing types                              |

Each reviewer prompt must include:

1. The PR number, head revision, and the list of changed files
2. Relevant context from Phase 2 (CLAUDE.md rules, PRP artifacts, PR description)
3. Its assigned categories and what to check (from the table above)
4. The severity rubric
5. A directive to return findings in the standard format below

Each reviewer returns findings as:

```markdown
## Findings

### CRITICAL

- `file.ts:42` — [description] [category]
  - Suggested fix: [fix]

### HIGH

- ...

### MEDIUM

- ...

### LOW

- ...
```

After all 3 reviewers return, **merge findings**:

1. Combine by severity (CRITICAL first, then HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW)
2. De-duplicate findings at the same `file:line` (if two reviewers flagged the same issue, keep the more severe one and list both concurring reviewers)
3. Sort within each severity by file path
4. Tag each finding with its source reviewer (`[correctness]`, `[security]`, `[quality]`) for traceability

Pass the merged findings to Phase 4 (VALIDATE) and downstream phases as if they came from a single-pass review.

**Note**: Validation commands (Phase 4) still run sequentially in the main skill — parallelization here only applies to the review pass.

#### Path C — Agent Team Review (`AGENT_TEAM_MODE=true`, Claude Code only)

> **MANDATORY — AGENT TEAMS REQUIRED**
>
> In Path C you MUST follow the agent-team lifecycle. Do NOT mix standalone sub-agents
> with team dispatch. Every `Agent` call below MUST include `team_name=` AND `name=`.
>
> 1. `TeamCreate` once at the start
> 2. `TaskCreate` for all 3 reviewer subtasks up front (flat graph — no dependencies)
> 3. Spawn 3 teammates: single message, three `Agent` calls with `team_name=` + `name=`
> 4. `TaskList` to monitor until all reviewers mark complete
> 5. `SendMessage({type:"shutdown_request"})` to all 3 teammates
> 6. `TeamDelete` before merging
>
> If `TeamCreate` or `TaskCreate` fails, abort the skill. Refer to
> `${CURSOR_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/_shared/references/agent-team-dispatch.md`
> for the full lifecycle contract.

Same 3-reviewer roster and category split as Path B, but dispatched as a coordinated team with a shared task list. Use this for larger PRs where reviewers will likely surface overlapping findings (e.g., a security hole that's also a correctness bug, or a performance issue that stems from a pattern violation) and you want them to cross-reference via `SendMessage` during review.

##### C.1 Build the team name

Team name: `crev-pr-<NUMBER>`. Use the PR number directly (no sanitization needed since PR numbers are always digits).

##### C.2 Create the team

```
TeamCreate: team_name="crev-pr-<NUMBER>", description="Code review team for PR #<NUMBER>: <PR title>"
```

On failure, abort.

##### C.3 Register subtasks

Create 3 tasks in the shared task list (flat graph — reviewers are independent):

```
TaskCreate: subject="correctness-reviewer: correctness/type-safety/completeness review for PR #<NUMBER>", description="<full reviewer prompt>"
TaskCreate: subject="security-reviewer: security/performance review for PR #<NUMBER>",                    description="<full reviewer prompt>"
TaskCreate: subject="quality-reviewer: pattern-compliance/maintainability review for PR #<NUMBER>",       description="<full reviewer prompt>"
```

If any `TaskCreate` fails → `TeamDelete`, then abort.

##### C.4 Spawn the 3 reviewers (single message, three Agent calls)

Dispatch all three teammates in **ONE message** with **THREE `Agent` tool calls**. Every call MUST include:

- `team_name`: `"crev-pr-<NUMBER>"`
- `name`: the reviewer name (`correctness-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`, `quality-reviewer`) — must match the `TaskCreate` subject prefix
- `subagent_type`: `"code-reviewer"`
- `description`: One-line task title (e.g., `"Correctness review for PR #42"`)
- `prompt`: The same reviewer prompt used in Path B (PR number, head revision, list of changed files, Phase 2 context — CLAUDE.md rules, PRP artifacts, PR description, assigned categories, severity rubric, expected findings format) PLUS a note that the teammate shares a task list with two sibling reviewers (name them) and may `SendMessage` them if it discovers a finding that overlaps their scope, and must call `TaskUpdate` to mark its task complete before returning.

##### C.5 Monitor and collect results

Use `TaskList` to confirm all 3 tasks are `completed` before merging. If a teammate messages the orchestrator, respond via `SendMessage`. Failure policy:

- All 3 error → `TeamDelete`, abort with a clear error.
- 1 or 2 error → record "partial review — {role} did not complete" and proceed with the remaining reviewers' findings. Note the gap in the Phase 6 artifact Summary.

##### C.6 Shutdown and cleanup

After all teammates have marked their tasks complete (or been recorded as failed):

```
SendMessage(to="correctness-reviewer", message={type:"shutdown_request"})
SendMessage(to="security-reviewer",    message={type:"shutdown_request"})
SendMessage(to="quality-reviewer",     message={type:"shutdown_request"})
TeamDelete
```

Always `TeamDelete` — even on abort or partial failure.

##### C.7 Merge findings

Apply the same merge procedure as Path B (combine by severity, de-dupe at `file:line`, sort by file path, attach reviewer source tags). Pass the merged findings to Phase 4 (VALIDATE).

**Note**: Validation commands (Phase 4), decision (Phase 5), report (Phase 6), and publish (Phase 7) all still run sequentially in the main skill — team-based coordination applies only to the review pass.

Assign severity to each finding:

| Severity     | Meaning                                     | Action                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **CRITICAL** | Security vulnerability or data loss risk    | Must fix before merge   |
| **HIGH**     | Bug or logic error likely to cause issues   | Should fix before merge |
| **MEDIUM**   | Code quality issue or missing best practice | Fix recommended         |
| **LOW**      | Style nit or minor suggestion               | Optional                |

### Phase 4 — VALIDATE

Run available validation commands.

Detect the project type from config files (`package.json`, `Cargo.toml`, `go.mod`, `pyproject.toml`, etc.), then run the appropriate commands:

**Node.js / TypeScript** (has `package.json`):

```bash
npm run typecheck 2>/dev/null || npx tsc --noEmit 2>/dev/null  # Type check
npm run lint                                                    # Lint
npm test                                                        # Tests
npm run build                                                   # Build
```

**Rust** (has `Cargo.toml`):

```bash
cargo clippy -- -D warnings  # Lint
cargo test                   # Tests
cargo build                  # Build
```

**Go** (has `go.mod`):

```bash
go vet ./...    # Lint
go test ./...   # Tests
go build ./...  # Build
```

**Python** (has `pyproject.toml` / `setup.py`):

```bash
pytest  # Tests
```

Run only the commands that apply to the detected project type. Record pass/fail for each.

### Phase 5 — DECIDE

Form recommendation based on findings:

| Condition                                    | Decision                          |
| -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Zero CRITICAL/HIGH issues, validation passes | **APPROVE**                       |
| Only MEDIUM/LOW issues, validation passes    | **APPROVE** with comments         |
| Any HIGH issues or validation failures       | **REQUEST CHANGES**               |
| Any CRITICAL issues                          | **BLOCK** — must fix before merge |

Special cases:

- Draft PR (with `--keep-draft`) → Always use **COMMENT** (not approve/block). Without `--keep-draft`, the PR is auto-promoted to ready before this decision runs, so normal severity-based decisions apply.
- Only docs/config changes → Lighter review, focus on correctness
- Explicit `--approve` or `--request-changes` flag → Override decision (but still report all findings)

### Phase 6 — REPORT

Assign sequential finding IDs (`F001`, `F002`, ...) ordered by severity (CRITICAL first) then by file path. Every finding receives `Status: Open` on first write.

#### Draft Promotion

At the very start of Phase 6, in PR mode, run the draft→ready promotion unless `--keep-draft` was set:

```bash
if [[ "$KEEP_DRAFT" != "true" ]]; then
  IS_DRAFT=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json isDraft --jq .isDraft)
  if [[ "$IS_DRAFT" == "true" ]]; then
    gh pr ready "$PR_NUMBER"
    echo "Promoted PR #$PR_NUMBER from draft to ready for review."
  fi
fi
```

#### Artifact Write

Write the artifact to `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/docs/prps/reviews/pr-<N>-review.md`. When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true` this resolves to the worktree top-level (e.g., `~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>/docs/prps/reviews/pr-<N>-review.md`); when `--no-worktree` is in effect, it resolves to the main repo. The artifact intentionally lives **with the PR branch** so it travels with the review history.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/docs/prps/reviews"
```

Use the **Review Artifact Format** defined at the bottom of this skill. The artifact must include finding IDs and `Status: Open` on every finding so that `/review-fix` can later update the file in place.

- Write the artifact to `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/docs/prps/reviews/pr-<N>-review.md`. When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true` this resolves to the worktree top-level (e.g., `~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>/docs/prps/reviews/pr-<N>-review.md`); when `--no-worktree` is in effect, it resolves to the main repo. The artifact intentionally lives **with the PR branch** so it travels with the review history.
- **Note**: the artifact will be committed to the PR branch (see commit step below). If you do not want the review record on the PR branch, add `docs/prps/reviews/` to `.gitignore` — the skill detects this and skips the commit.
- Emit only severity rows in `## Worktree Setup` whose severity has at least one Open finding in the artifact. Omit rows for empty severities.

#### Artifact Commit + Push

After the artifact has been written, in PR mode when `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`, commit and push it to the PR branch before posting the review:

```bash
if [[ "$WORKTREE_ACTIVE" == "true" ]]; then
  ARTIFACT_REL="docs/prps/reviews/pr-${PR_NUMBER}-review.md"
  pushd "$WORKTREE_PATH" >/dev/null
  if git check-ignore -q "$ARTIFACT_REL"; then
    echo "Artifact path is gitignored; skipping commit. Worktree preserved at $WORKTREE_PATH."
    KEEP_WORKTREE=true
  else
    git add "$ARTIFACT_REL"
    git commit -m "docs(review): add review artifact for PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
    git push
    echo "Committed and pushed review artifact to PR #${PR_NUMBER} branch."
  fi
  popd >/dev/null
fi
```

Example of the Findings section:

```markdown
## Findings

### CRITICAL

- **[F001]** `src/auth.ts:42` — SQL injection in user lookup query
  - **Status**: Open
  - **Category**: Security
  - **Suggested fix**: Use parameterized query via `db.query('... WHERE id = $1', [userId])`

### HIGH

- **[F002]** `src/api/payments.ts:17` — Missing null check on `req.body.amount`
  - **Status**: Open
  - **Category**: Correctness
  - **Suggested fix**: Validate `typeof amount === 'number' && amount > 0` before processing

### MEDIUM

- **[F003]** `src/utils/format.ts:83` — Function exceeds 50 lines (78 lines)
  - **Status**: Open
  - **Category**: Maintainability
  - **Suggested fix**: Extract the date parsing block into a helper

### LOW

- **[F004]** `src/app.ts:5` — Missing JSDoc on public export `initApp`
  - **Status**: Open
  - **Category**: Maintainability
  - **Suggested fix**: Add a one-line JSDoc describing arguments and return type
```

The artifact MUST also include these sections:

- **Header**: PR number, title, author, branch, decision, reviewed timestamp
- **Summary**: 1-2 sentence overall assessment
- **Validation Results**: type-check / lint / tests / build pass-fail table
- **Files Reviewed**: list of changed files with Added/Modified/Deleted tags

### Phase 7 — PUBLISH

Post the review to GitHub:

```bash
# If APPROVE
gh pr review <NUMBER> --approve --body "<summary of review>"

# If REQUEST CHANGES
gh pr review <NUMBER> --request-changes --body "<summary with required fixes>"

# If BLOCK (GitHub has no dedicated BLOCK event; map to request-changes)
gh pr review <NUMBER> --request-changes --body "<blocking issues must be fixed before merge>"

# If COMMENT only (draft PR or informational)
gh pr review <NUMBER> --comment --body "<summary>"
```

For inline comments on specific lines, use the GitHub review comments API:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<NUMBER>/comments" \
  -f body="<comment>" \
  -f path="<file>" \
  -F line=<line-number> \
  -f side="RIGHT" \
  -f commit_id="$(gh pr view <NUMBER> --json headRefOid --jq .headRefOid)"
```

Alternatively, post a single review with multiple inline comments at once:

```bash
gh api "repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<NUMBER>/reviews" \
  -f event="COMMENT" \
  -f body="<overall summary>" \
  --input comments.json  # [{"path": "file", "line": N, "body": "comment"}, ...]
```

#### Worktree Cleanup

After `gh pr review` succeeds, remove the worktree unless `--keep-worktree` is set or the worktree is dirty:

```bash
if [[ "$WORKTREE_ACTIVE" == "true" && "$KEEP_WORKTREE" != "true" && -n "$WORKTREE_PATH" ]]; then
  DIRTY=$(git -C "$WORKTREE_PATH" status --porcelain)
  if [[ -n "$DIRTY" ]]; then
    echo "Worktree has uncommitted changes; skipping cleanup. Inspect: $WORKTREE_PATH"
  else
    git worktree remove "$WORKTREE_PATH"
    echo "Removed worktree $WORKTREE_PATH."
  fi
fi
```

The local PR branch is intentionally left alone; branch deletion is out of scope.

### Phase 8 — OUTPUT

Report to user:

```
PR #<NUMBER>: <TITLE>
Decision: <APPROVE|REQUEST_CHANGES|BLOCK>

Issues: <critical_count> critical, <high_count> high, <medium_count> medium, <low_count> low
Validation: <pass_count>/<total_count> checks passed

Artifacts:
  Review: docs/prps/reviews/pr-<NUMBER>-review.md
  GitHub: <PR URL>

Next steps:
  - <contextual suggestions based on decision>
```

## Review Artifact Format

Both Local Review Mode and PR Review Mode write an artifact using this exact format. The format is the contract that `/review-fix` parses — do not deviate.

### File locations

| Mode  | Path                                                  |
| ----- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Local | `docs/prps/reviews/local-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-review.md` |
| PR    | `docs/prps/reviews/pr-{NUMBER}-review.md`             |
| Quick | `docs/prps/reviews/quick-{YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS}-review.md` |

### Template

```markdown
# [Local Review | PR Review #<NUMBER>] — <TITLE or "Uncommitted Changes">

**Reviewed**: <ISO date>
**Mode**: Local | PR
**Author**: <author | "local">
**Branch**: <head> → <base>
**Decision**: APPROVE | REQUEST CHANGES | BLOCK | COMMENT

## Worktree Setup

<!-- Only emitted when the review was run with --worktree and WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true.
     Lists only severity levels that have at least one Open finding. -->

- **Parent**: ~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>/ (branch: <pr-head-branch>)
- **Children** (per severity; created by /review-fix --worktree):
  - CRITICAL → ~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>-critical/ (branch: feat/pr-<N>-critical)
  - HIGH → ~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>-high/ (branch: feat/pr-<N>-high)
  - MEDIUM → ~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>-medium/ (branch: feat/pr-<N>-medium)
  - LOW → ~/.claude-worktrees/<repo>-pr-<N>-low/ (branch: feat/pr-<N>-low)

> **Quick mode variant**: Quick reviews omit `## Validation Results` (no toolchain runs) and `## Worktree Setup` (no worktree is ever created). All other sections — Header, Summary, Findings (with full `[F###]`, `Status:`, `Category:`, `Suggested fix:` fields per finding), Files Reviewed — are identical to the standard template. This keeps the file parseable by `/review-fix` without special-casing.

### Finding ID rules

- **Sequential**: IDs start at `F001` and increment by one.
- **Stable per file**: Once assigned in a given review artifact, an ID is never renumbered, even after a fix is applied.
- **Per-artifact**: IDs are scoped to a single review file. A fresh code-review pass generates a new file with its own `F001`-restart counter.
- **Assigned in REPORT phase**: In both sequential and parallel paths, IDs are assigned during the REPORT phase (Phase 3 for local, Phase 6 for PR), AFTER merge and sort. Reviewer agents in parallel mode do NOT assign IDs.

### Status field rules

Every finding MUST have a `Status` field. Valid values:

| Status | Meaning                                                                                                      |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Open   | Default on first write. Not yet processed by `/review-fix`, or below the fix skill's severity threshold. |
| Fixed  | Successfully fixed by `/review-fix`. Set by the fix skill — code-review itself never writes this.        |
| Failed | Attempted by `/review-fix` but the fix broke validation. Set by the fix skill.                           |

`/code-review` only ever writes `Status: Open`. All other states are set in-place by `/review-fix`.

### Required fields per finding

Every finding must include these four lines (in this order) so the artifact is machine-parseable:

```
- **[F###]** `file:line` — <description>
  - **Status**: <Open|Fixed|Failed>
  - **Category**: <category>
  - **Suggested fix**: <concrete fix>
```

Findings missing a `Suggested fix` line are valid but will be **skipped** by `/review-fix` (flagged for human judgment).

## Edge Cases

- **No `gh` CLI and no GitHub MCP**: Fall back to local-only review (read the diff, skip GitHub publish). Warn user.
- **Diverged branches**: Suggest `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/<base>` before review.
- **Large PRs (>50 files)**: Warn about review scope. Focus on source changes first, then tests, then config/docs.
- **Stale PR head (default worktree mode)**: the worktree is a snapshot of the PR head at SETUP time. If new commits land on the PR after the review starts, re-run to resync.
- **Concurrent runs**: two `/code-review <N>` invocations on different PR numbers never collide (each gets its own `<repo>-pr-<N>/` directory). Two invocations on the SAME PR number share the same parent worktree (idempotent), which is by design.
- **Cleanup**: worktrees are removed automatically after the review is posted (Phase 7 Worktree Cleanup). Pass `--keep-worktree` to retain the worktree. If the worktree is dirty, cleanup is skipped and you are told where to inspect. Use `--no-worktree` for the previous behavior (no worktree created or removed).
