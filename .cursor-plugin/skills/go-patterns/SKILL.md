description: Idiomatic Go patterns, best practices, and conventions for building robust, efficient, and maintainable Go applications. Use when the user is writing new Go code, reviewing Go code, refactoring Go, designing Go packages/modules, asks "how should I structure this in Go", asks about Go error wrapping with errors.Is/errors.As, asks about goroutines/channels/context/errgroup, asks about interface design (accept interfaces, return structs), asks about functional options or embedding, or wants Go idioms and anti-patterns.

# Go Development Patterns

Idiomatic Go patterns and best practices for building robust, efficient, and maintainable applications.

## When to Activate

- Writing new Go code
- Reviewing Go code
- Refactoring existing Go code
- Designing Go packages/modules

## Critical Rules

- Make the zero value useful.
- Accept interfaces, return structs; define interfaces where they are used.
- Wrap errors with context using `%w`; check with `errors.Is` / `errors.As`.
- Never silently ignore errors; handle them or document why ignoring is safe.
- Pass `context.Context` as the first parameter, never in a struct.
- Avoid goroutine leaks: handle cancellation (`ctx.Done()`) so goroutines never block forever.
- Inject dependencies instead of using package-level state.
- Format with `gofmt` / `goimports`.

## Quick Reference: Go Idioms

| Idiom                                               | Description                                              |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Accept interfaces, return structs                   | Functions accept interface params, return concrete types |
| Errors are values                                   | Treat errors as first-class values, not exceptions       |
| Don't communicate by sharing memory                 | Use channels for coordination between goroutines         |
| Make the zero value useful                          | Types should work without explicit initialization        |
| A little copying is better than a little dependency | Avoid unnecessary external dependencies                  |
| Clear is better than clever                         | Prioritize readability over cleverness                   |
| gofmt is no one's favorite but everyone's friend    | Always format with gofmt/goimports                       |
| Return early                                        | Handle errors first, keep happy path unindented          |

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

```go
// Bad: Naked returns in long functions
func process() (result int, err error) {
    // ... 50 lines ...
    return // What is being returned?
}

// Bad: Using panic for control flow
func GetUser(id string) *User {
    user, err := db.Find(id)
    if err != nil {
        panic(err) // Don't do this
    }
    return user
}

// Bad: Passing context in struct
type Request struct {
    ctx context.Context // Context should be first param
    ID  string
}

// Good: Context as first parameter
func ProcessRequest(ctx context.Context, id string) error {
    // ...
}

// Bad: Mixing value and pointer receivers
type Counter struct{ n int }
func (c Counter) Value() int { return c.n }    // Value receiver
func (c *Counter) Increment() { c.n++ }        // Pointer receiver
// Pick one style and be consistent
```

**Remember**: Go code should be boring in the best way - predictable, consistent, and easy to understand. When in doubt, keep it simple.
