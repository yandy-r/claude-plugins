## Section Guidelines

### Executive Summary

The summary should answer in 3-5 sentences:

- What does this feature do?
- Why is it valuable?
- How will it be built (high-level)?
- What are the key challenges?

**Good Example:**

```markdown
## Executive Summary

This feature integrates Plex media library filtering and playlist management into the application. Users can query their Plex server using native filters (rating, genre, year) to find media, then copy selected items to a destination folder while maintaining metadata. The implementation uses the Plex API v2 with X-Plex-Token authentication, requiring a new PlexService component and database tables for tracking sync state. Primary challenges include handling large libraries efficiently and managing the async nature of Plex library scans.
```

**Bad Example:**

```markdown
## Executive Summary

This feature adds Plex integration. It will help users manage their media.
```

### External Dependencies

List external services with enough detail for implementation:

- Documentation URLs (must be real, working links)
- Authentication specifics
- Key endpoints with purposes
- Constraints that affect design

### Business Requirements

Focus on user value and business rules:

- User stories should follow the "As a... I want... so that..." format
- Business rules should be specific and testable
- Edge cases should have clear expected behaviors
- Success criteria should be measurable

### Technical Specifications

Provide implementation-ready details:

- Data models with actual column definitions
- API contracts with request/response examples
- Architecture diagrams showing component relationships
- File paths for new and modified code

### UX Considerations

Document user-facing behavior:

- Step-by-step workflows
- Error messages and recovery paths
- Loading states and feedback patterns
- Accessibility requirements

### Recommendations

Synthesize research into actionable guidance:

- Clear implementation recommendation
- Justified technology choices
- Risk mitigation strategies
- Future enhancement opportunities

### Task Breakdown Preview

Provide high-level structure for plan-workflow:

- Logical phases
- Task groupings
- Dependency relationships
- Parallelization opportunities

## Integration with plan-workflow

The feature-spec.md is read by plan-workflow (or can be used with shared-context) to:

1. **Inform shared.md creation** - Relevant files, patterns, tables
2. **Guide task breakdown** - Business rules become acceptance criteria
3. **Provide technical context** - Data models and APIs inform implementation
4. **Enable parallel planning** - Task preview suggests phase structure

Ensure feature-spec.md is comprehensive enough that planning can proceed without additional research rounds.
