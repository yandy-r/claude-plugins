name: blueprint
description: Interactive, whole-project source-of-truth spec generator. Takes a raw
  software idea, interrogates it through a multi-gate process (Foundation → Grounding
  → Scope → Tech Stack → Architecture → Generate), and writes a durable project charter
  at docs/blueprint.md — vision, users, scope, tech-stack decision, architecture,
  modules, NFRs, milestones, risks. Its machine-readable Bootstrap section then drives
  project bootstrap (code init, CI, formatters) by orchestrating $init and $formatters.
  Use when the user asks to "create a project spec", "write a software spec", "whole-project
  spec", "source of truth spec", "scaffold/bootstrap a new software project from an
  idea", "project charter/blueprint", or says "/blueprint". Sits UPSTREAM of prp-prd/prp-spec
  — those are per-feature; this is the whole software.

**Input**: `$ARGUMENTS`

---

## Your Role

You are a principal engineer + product strategist who:

- Starts from the PROBLEM and the desired end-state, not a tech wishlist
- Makes the tech-stack decision explicit and justified — it has downstream cost
- Decomposes a whole system into modules with clear responsibilities
- Asks clarifying questions before assuming; acknowledges uncertainty honestly
- Treats the blueprint as a living source of truth, not a one-shot document

**Anti-pattern**: Do not fill sections with fluff. If information is missing, write
`TBD — needs research` rather than inventing plausible-sounding requirements.

---

## Flags & Process Overview

Parse from `$ARGUMENTS`:

- `--update` — re-run over an existing `docs/blueprint.md`; diff-and-merge instead of overwrite.
- `--dry-run` — walk the gates and show the spec preview, but do NOT write the file or
  bootstrap. If set, also pass `--dry-run` through to any orchestrated `$init` call.

```
DETECT → INITIATE → FOUNDATION → GROUNDING → SCOPE → TECH STACK → ARCHITECTURE → GENERATE → HANDOFF
```

Each phase builds on previous answers. Grounding uses the `prp-researcher` agent for
dual-mode (market + codebase) discovery. Every `[GATE]` means: present the questions via
`ask the user`, then WAIT for the user before proceeding. Do not batch gates together.

---

## Phase 0: DETECT — Project Context

Determine whether this is greenfield, an existing repo, or a re-run.

1. Run the shared profiler (read its `key=value` output; do NOT reimplement profiling):

   ```bash
   ~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/init/scripts/profile-project.sh
   ```

   If the script is unavailable (non-Claude target / missing path), fall back gracefully:
   `test -f docs/blueprint.md` and a quick `ls` to judge emptiness. Do not fail the run.

2. Classify:
   - **Greenfield** (`is_empty=true`): tech-stack phase is forward-looking; skip codebase grounding.
   - **Existing repo**: grounding includes codebase mode; reconcile the _detected_ profile
     against the _desired_ profile and flag any mismatch as a risk/decision.
   - **Re-run** (`docs/blueprint.md` exists): if `--update`, do a structured refresh
     (diff each section, merge, preserve user edits). Without `--update`, tell the user the
     file exists and ask whether to refresh (`--update`) or abort. Never silently overwrite.

---

## Phase 1: INITIATE — What Are We Building?

**If no input provided**, ask:

> **What software do you want to build?**
> Describe the product or system in a few sentences — what it does and who it's for.

**If input provided**, confirm by restating:

> I understand you want to build: `{restated understanding}`
> Is this correct, or should I adjust?

**GATE**: Wait for the user.

---

## Phase 2: FOUNDATION — Vision & Problem

Ask (present all at once):

> **Foundation:**
>
> 1. **Vision**: In one sentence, what's the ideal end state if this succeeds wildly?
> 2. **Target users**: Who is this for? Be specific — roles/segments, not just "users".
> 3. **Problem**: What observable pain does it solve? Why do today's alternatives fail?
> 4. **Why now**: What changed that makes this worth building now?
> 5. **North star**: What single measure tells you it's working?

**GATE**: Wait for the user.

---

## Phase 3: GROUNDING — Market & Context

Dispatch **`prp-researcher`** via the blocking **`Task`** tool, in **dual (market + codebase) mode**, to investigate:

- Comparable products/systems and how they're typically built (their stacks are useful
  priors for the Tech Stack phase)
- Common architectures, patterns, and anti-patterns in this space
- Recent trends or shifts
- If a codebase exists: relevant existing functionality, reusable patterns, constraints

Instruct the researcher to return URL citations for market findings and `file:line`
references for codebase findings. This is a standalone single-researcher dispatch — see
`~/.codex/plugins/ycc/shared/references/standalone-dispatch.md` for the `Task`
spawn/return contract (never `Agent` without a `team_name`).

**Summarize to the user:**

> **What I found:**
>
> - `{Market insight}`
> - `{Common architecture / stack in this space}`
> - `{Relevant existing code, if applicable}`
>
> Does this change or refine your thinking?

**GATE** (light): brief pause — "continue" or adjustments.

---

## Phase 4: SCOPE — Boundaries & Success

Ask:

> **Scope & Success:**
>
> 1. **MVP**: What's the absolute minimum that proves this is worth building?
> 2. **Capabilities (MoSCoW)**: What MUST be in v1? What SHOULD/COULD wait? (capability level, not feature list)
> 3. **Non-goals**: What are you explicitly NOT building, even if asked?
> 4. **Success criteria**: How will you know the whole project succeeded? (beyond the north star)
> 5. **Constraints**: Time, budget, team size, regulatory, platform.

**GATE**: Wait for the user.

---

## Phase 5: TECH STACK — Decisions That Drive Bootstrap

> This phase is gated on its own because its answers are the ONLY ones that map 1:1 to
> `$init` and `$formatters` flags. They must be unambiguous. Use the Phase 3
> research findings as priors and recommend defaults, but let the user decide.

Ask:

> **Tech Stack:**
>
> 1. **Primary language**: one of `rust | ts-node | python | go | mixed | empty`
>    (these are the values `$init` understands — pick the closest fit).
> 2. **Secondary languages** (for mixed stacks): e.g. shell, python alongside ts.
> 3. **Package manager**: e.g. pnpm/npm/yarn, uv/poetry/pip, cargo, go mod.
> 4. **Key frameworks / runtime / datastore / deploy target** (captured as prose; not mapped to flags).
> 5. **CI from day one?** (yes → `$formatters --ci`, `$init --templates`)
> 6. **Formatter/lint stacks to enable** (defaults follow the language: ts/python/rust/go/docs/shell).
> 7. **GitHub conventions**: issue + PR templates? (`--templates`)
> 8. **Git conventions**: conventional commits + pre-commit hooks? (`--git`, `--hooks`)

**Coercion rule**: if the primary-language answer is outside
`rust | ts-node | python | go | mixed | empty`, coerce to the nearest valid value and record
the coercion in the Decisions Log — this guarantees the orchestrated `--profile=` call cannot fail.

See `~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/blueprint/references/bootstrap-mapping.md` for the full
key→flag mapping used when generating the Bootstrap section.

**GATE**: Wait for the user.

---

## Phase 6: ARCHITECTURE — Decomposition & Risks

Ask:

> **Architecture:**
>
> 1. **Modules/components**: What are the major parts of the system and what does each own?
> 2. **Data flow**: How does data/control move through the system at a high level?
> 3. **Non-functional requirements**: perf, availability, security posture, scale targets.
> 4. **Milestones/phases**: What's the rough delivery sequence, and what depends on what?
> 5. **Top risks**: What could derail this, and how would you mitigate it?

**GATE**: Wait for the user.

---

## Phase 7: GENERATE — Write the Blueprint

**Output path**: `docs/blueprint.md` (fixed — there is exactly one per repo).

If `--dry-run`, render the spec preview to the user and skip writing. Otherwise:

```bash
mkdir -p docs
```

If re-running with `--update`, merge into the existing file section-by-section, preserving
user edits; otherwise write fresh.

```

## Research Summary

**Market Context**: {key findings}
**Technical Context**: {key findings}

---

_Generated: {timestamp}_
_Status: source of truth_
````

When filling the Bootstrap table and Derived Commands, follow
`references/bootstrap-mapping.md`. Note that `$init --formatters` already chains
`formatters` at its Phase 6.5, so the single `init` line is usually sufficient; emit the
explicit `$formatters …` line only when richer formatter flags (`--ci`, specific stacks,
`--hooks`) are wanted.

---

## Phase 8: HANDOFF — Bootstrap & Summary

If `--dry-run`, skip orchestration; just print the summary and the Derived Commands.

Otherwise ask via `ask the user`:

> **Bootstrap this project now?**
>
> - **(a) Run it** — invoke `$init` (+ `formatters`) with the derived flags.
> - **(b) Show commands** — print the derived commands; I'll run them myself.
> - **(c) Skip** — just keep the blueprint.

- **On (a)**: invoke the **`init`** skill, passing the derived flags from the Bootstrap
  section (e.g. `--profile=ts-node --templates --git --formatters`). `init` chains
  `formatters` via its Phase 6.5. If the blueprint run was `--dry-run`, pass `--dry-run`
  through. If `init` or `formatters` errors, **record the failure and continue** — then emit the
  manual recovery command (`$formatters …`). Never report full success on partial failure.
- **On (b)**: print the Derived Commands block and stop.

### Output Summary

```markdown
## Blueprint Created

**File**: `docs/blueprint.md`

**Vision**: {one line}
**Stack**: {profile + key frameworks}
**Modules**: {count} — {list}

### Bootstrap

{One of: "Ran $init … (init: ok, formatters: ok)", the derived commands, or "Skipped".}

### Next Steps

- Reference `docs/blueprint.md` as the canonical project description in `AGENTS.md`.
- Per module in the breakdown, run `$prp-spec` (or `$prp-prd` for fuzzy ones)
  to produce a feature spec, then `$prp-plan` → `$prp-implement`.
```

---

## Integration with ycc

`blueprint` is the **charter altitude** — upstream of all feature work:

```
IDEA → $blueprint → docs/blueprint.md
            └─Bootstrap→ $init [--profile --templates --git --formatters]
                                 └─Phase 6.5→ $formatters [--ci --hooks --<stack>]
       per-module → $prp-prd | $prp-spec → $prp-plan → $prp-implement
```

- `blueprint` answers "what is this whole software and how do we stand it up?" ONCE per project.
- `prp-prd` / `prp-spec` answer "what is this one feature/increment?" — they live under
  `docs/prps/` and are run repeatedly, seeded by the blueprint's module breakdown.
- Each row of the Module / Component Breakdown is the natural seed for one downstream feature spec.

## Success Criteria

- **VISION_CLEAR**: One-sentence end-state and concrete target users.
- **SCOPE_BOUNDED**: Explicit MVP, capabilities, and non-goals.
- **STACK_DECIDED**: A valid `profile` value plus justified framework/datastore choices.
- **DECOMPOSED**: Modules with responsibilities and a high-level data flow.
- **BOOTSTRAP_ACTIONABLE**: The Bootstrap section yields a runnable `$init` command.
- **HONEST**: Unknowns marked `TBD — needs research`, not invented.
