description: Generate a lightweight feature spec for the PRP workflow — single-pass
  with optional codebase/market grounding via prp-researcher. Produces a concise spec
  at docs/prps/specs/{name}.spec.md covering problem statement, requirements, technical
  approach, integration points, and risks. Accepts a PRD file, free-form description,
  or starts with clarifying questions. Use when the user asks to "write a spec", "spec
  out a feature", "quick spec", "create a PRP spec", or says "/prp-spec". For heavyweight
  multi-agent research, use feature-research instead.

# PRP Spec

Generate a concise, actionable feature specification in a single pass. Lighter than `feature-research` (no multi-agent team), heavier than a PRD (includes technical approach and integration points).

> Part of the PRP workflow series.

**Core Philosophy**: A spec captures WHAT to build and WHY, with enough technical direction to feed directly into `prp-plan`. It does NOT capture HOW in implementation detail — that is the plan's job.

---

## Key Distinctions

| This skill (`prp-spec`) | NOT this (`feature-research`) | NOT this (`prp-prd`) |
|---|---|---|
| Single-pass spec generation | 7-agent parallel research team | Interactive PRD with hypothesis |
| `docs/prps/specs/` | `docs/plans/[name]/` | `docs/prps/prds/` |
| 1 output file | 8 output files (7 research + spec) | 1 output file |
| Optional researcher dispatch | Always deploys full team | Always dispatches researcher |
| Technical approach included | Full technical specifications | Problem-first, solution-light |
| 1 GATE wait for clarification | Runs without GATEs | 6 GATE waits through phases |

Reach for `feature-research` when external APIs need deep investigation across many domains. Reach for `prp-prd` when the problem itself is unclear. Use this skill when the problem is clear and the goal is a concise, planner-ready spec.

---

## Your Role

You are a pragmatic technical writer who:

- Captures the minimum viable specification to unblock planning
- Names concrete requirements, not aspirations
- Flags unknowns explicitly rather than fabricating confidence
- Trusts the caller to refine rather than over-spec'ing

**Anti-pattern**: Do not fill sections with filler. Write `TBD — needs grounding` or `UNKNOWN — see Open Questions` rather than inventing plausible-sounding content.

---

## Phase 0 — DETECT

### Flag Parsing

Extract flags from `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Flag | Effect |
|---|---|
| `--ground` | Dispatch `prp-researcher` in dual mode for codebase + market grounding before generating |

Strip the flag, set `GROUND_MODE=true|false`. The remaining text is the feature description or PRD path.

### Input Detection

| Input Pattern | Action |
|---|---|
| Path ending in `.prd.md` | Read PRD, extract problem + requirements + phase context as seed |
| Path to other `.md` file | Read for context, treat as input |
| Free-form text | Proceed to Phase 1 |
| Empty | Ask the user what to spec |

### Feature Name Derivation

Derive a kebab-case `{name}` from the input:
- From a PRD path: use the PRD's basename (strip `.prd.md`)
- From free-form text: convert the first 3-5 meaningful words to kebab-case
- Confirm the derived name with the user if ambiguous

---

## Phase 1 — CLARIFY

**If no input or vague input**, ask:

> **What feature do you want to spec?**
> Describe the capability in 2-3 sentences — what it does and who it serves.

**GATE**: Wait for user response.

**If input provided (or PRD parsed)**, restate understanding and ask focused questions:

> I understand you want to spec: `{restated understanding}`
>
> Before I generate, a few clarifying questions:
>
> 1. **Scope**: Is this a standalone feature, an extension of something existing, or a replacement?
> 2. **Constraints**: Any known technical constraints or decisions already made?
> 3. **Priority**: What are the must-have vs. nice-to-have aspects?

**GATE**: Wait for user responses. Accept "skip" or "none" to proceed without answers — capture that as `UNKNOWN` in the spec.

---

## Phase 2 — GROUND (optional)

**Trigger conditions**: Run this phase if `GROUND_MODE=true` OR the feature clearly involves external APIs, libraries, or unfamiliar domains.

**If skipped**: Report "Generating spec from provided context only — use `--ground` for researcher-backed discovery."

**If running**: Dispatch a single `prp-researcher` agent in dual mode (codebase + market):

- Codebase side: similar implementations, relevant types, existing patterns, integration points already in place
- Market side: competitor approaches, library options, API documentation, known gotchas

Instruct the researcher to return the compact discovery table format (codebase) and KEY_INSIGHT format (market) — do NOT ask for recommendations or opinions.

**Summarize findings to the user before generating**:

> **Grounding results:**
>
> - {Codebase finding 1 with file:line}
> - {Market finding 1 with URL}
> - {Key constraint or opportunity}
>
> Generating spec with these findings incorporated.

---

## Phase 3 — GENERATE

**Output path**: `docs/prps/specs/{kebab-case-name}.spec.md`

Create the directory if needed:

```bash
mkdir -p docs/prps/specs
```

### Spec Template

Write the spec using this exact structure. Preserve section ordering.

```markdown
# Spec: {Feature Name}

## Problem Statement

{2-3 sentences: What problem exists, who has it, and what the cost of not solving it is.}

## Requirements

### Functional

| # | Requirement | Priority | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | {requirement} | Must | {context} |
| F2 | {requirement} | Must | {context} |
| F3 | {requirement} | Should | {context} |
| F4 | {requirement} | Could | {context} |

### Non-Functional

| # | Requirement | Target | Rationale |
|---|---|---|---|
| NF1 | {e.g., Response time} | {e.g., <200ms p95} | {why} |
| NF2 | {e.g., Availability} | {e.g., 99.9%} | {why} |

## Technical Approach

**Strategy**: {1-2 sentence high-level approach}

**Architecture Decisions**:

- {Decision 1}: {choice} because {rationale}
- {Decision 2}: {choice} because {rationale}

**Key Components**:

- `{component}`: {responsibility}
- `{component}`: {responsibility}

## Integration Points

| System/Service | Direction | Protocol | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| {system} | {inbound/outbound/both} | {REST/gRPC/etc.} | {key detail} |

## Risks & Unknowns

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|---|---|---|---|
| {risk} | {H/M/L} | {H/M/L} | {strategy} |

## Open Questions

- [ ] {Question that needs answering before implementation}
- [ ] {Question that could change the approach}

---

_Source: {PRD path or "free-form description"}_
_Generated: {timestamp}_
_Status: DRAFT — ready for prp-plan_
```

### Writing Principles

- **Be concrete**: Requirements name specific behaviors, not vague intents
- **Use MoSCoW priorities**: Must / Should / Could / Won't — no "high/medium/low"
- **Surface unknowns**: Every gap becomes an Open Question; do not paper over
- **Cite grounding findings**: If Phase 2 ran, reference file:line or URLs in Notes/Rationale columns
- **Keep it short**: A good spec is 1-2 pages rendered, not 10

---

## Phase 4 — OUTPUT

Report to the user:

```markdown
## Spec Created

**File**: `docs/prps/specs/{name}.spec.md`

### Summary

- **Problem**: {one line}
- **Requirements**: {N functional, M non-functional}
- **Technical approach**: {one line}
- **Top risk**: {primary risk}
- **Open questions**: {count}

### Next Steps

- Review and refine the spec
- Run `$prp-plan docs/prps/specs/{name}.spec.md` to create an implementation plan
- Run `$prp-prd` first if a full hypothesis-driven PRD is needed
```

## Anti-patterns — Do NOT Do These

1. **Do NOT deploy a multi-agent team**: This is a single-pass skill. For multi-agent research, use `$feature-research`. If tempted to use `create an agent group`, stop — this skill does not have that tool allowed.

2. **Do NOT output to `docs/plans/`**: Specs go to `docs/prps/specs/`. The `docs/plans/` tree belongs to the `feature-research` / `plan-workflow` track. Always write to `docs/prps/specs/` regardless of the user's current working directory.

3. **Do NOT write implementation details**: The spec captures WHAT and WHY, not HOW. Implementation steps, file paths, and code snippets belong in the plan produced by `prp-plan`.

4. **Do NOT skip the GATE waits**: Always wait for user confirmation in Phase 1 before generating. The clarification questions exist to prevent speculative specs.

5. **Do NOT fabricate grounding findings**: If `GROUND_MODE=false` and no researcher ran, leave Rationale/Notes columns empty or marked `TBD` rather than inventing justifications.

6. **Do NOT act as a PRD generator**: This skill is not problem-first and does not run hypothesis questioning. For that, use `$prp-prd`.

---

## Integration

- **Upstream**: Accepts PRD files from `$prp-prd` or free-form descriptions. Can be invoked standalone.
- **Downstream**: Specs feed into `$prp-plan` for implementation planning. `prp-plan` recognizes `.spec.md` files as input.
- **Grounding**: Optionally dispatches `prp-researcher` in dual mode for codebase + market discovery.
- **Parallel track**: For heavyweight multi-agent research, use `$feature-research` instead (outputs to `docs/plans/`).

## Success Criteria

- **CLEAR_PROBLEM**: Problem Statement is specific and names who is affected
- **CONCRETE_REQUIREMENTS**: Functional requirements are testable; non-functional requirements have targets
- **APPROACH_NAMED**: Technical Approach names a strategy and key components, even if tentative
- **UNKNOWNS_SURFACED**: Gaps are in Open Questions, not hidden inside other sections
- **PLANNER_READY**: A reader can take this spec to `prp-plan` and produce an implementation plan without going back to the user
