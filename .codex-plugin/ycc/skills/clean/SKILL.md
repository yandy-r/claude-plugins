# Project File Cleaner

Orchestrate 6 parallel cleanup agents to analyze and remove unnecessary files from project directories with comprehensive safety measures and user confirmation checkpoints.

## Arguments

Parse `$ARGUMENTS` for:

- **target-directory**: First non-flag argument (default: `.`)
- **--dry-run**: Preview only, no changes
- **--report-only**: Generate report without deletions
- **--safe-mode**: Extra confirmation per category
- **--include-git**: Analyze git artifacts (large files, stale branches)

## Phase 0: Setup

1. **Validate target directory** exists
2. **Detect project type** using: `~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/clean/scripts/detect-project-type.sh "$TARGET_DIR"`
3. **Read safety configuration** from `~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/clean/references/safety-config.md`
4. **Create working directory**: `$TARGET_DIR/.cleanup-analysis/findings/`
5. **Initialize progress tracking** with the task tracker for all phases
6. **If --dry-run**: Display analysis plan and **STOP**

## Phase 1: Parallel Agent Deployment

Read agent prompts from `~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/clean/references/agent-prompts.md`.

Deploy all 6 agents in a **SINGLE message** with **MULTIPLE parallel agent runs** using subagent type `project-file-cleaner`:

| Agent      | Output File                 |
| ---------- | --------------------------- |
| Code Files | `findings/code-files.md`    |
| Binaries   | `findings/binaries.md`      |
| Assets     | `findings/assets.md`        |
| Docs       | `findings/documentation.md` |
| Config     | `findings/config.md`        |
| Docker     | `findings/docker.md`        |

Substitute `{{TARGET_DIR}}`, `{{PROJECT_TYPE}}`, and `{{OUTPUT_FILE}}` in each prompt. Each agent receives: target directory, project type, safety configuration, specific search patterns, and output file path.

## Phase 2: Findings Consolidation

After all agents complete:

1. Read all findings files
2. Deduplicate across agents
3. Calculate space savings: `du -h "$filepath"` for each file
4. Categorize by risk level (low/medium/high)

## Phase 3: Report Generation and User Review

1. Run: `~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/clean/scripts/generate-report.sh "$TARGET_DIR"`
2. Run safety validation: `~/.codex/plugins/ycc/skills/clean/scripts/validate-safety.sh "$TARGET_DIR/.cleanup-analysis/cleanup-report.md"`
3. Fix any violations before proceeding
4. **If --report-only**: Display report summary and **STOP**
5. Present findings to user with ask the user (show report / summary / proceed / cancel)
6. **If --safe-mode**: Ask confirmation per category

## Phase 4: Safe Execution

1. Create backup list at `$TARGET_DIR/.cleanup-analysis/removal-list.txt`
2. Final confirmation with ask the user before any deletions
3. Execute removal, tracking success/failure counts
4. Handle errors gracefully (continue on single file failure)

## Phase 5: Verification

1. Verify files removed, no broken symlinks, project integrity
2. Calculate actual space recovered
3. Generate final summary with results, analysis file locations, and next steps

---

## Quality Standards

Each cleanup agent must: focus on specific category, execute 10+ diverse searches, include file sizes, check against safety config, flag uncertain cases for review. Each finding must include: full path, size, category, justification, risk level, confidence level.

## Important Notes

- Act as orchestrator - coordinate cleanup agents, don't analyze files directly
- Deploy all 6 agents in parallel (single message with 6 Task calls)
- Safety first - always validate before deletion
- User confirmation required before any destructive operations
- Preserve all cleanup reports and removal lists
