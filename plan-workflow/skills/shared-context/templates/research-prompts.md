# Research Agent Prompts

These prompts are used to spawn research teammates for gathering shared context. Teammates work as a coordinated team, sharing findings with each other via messages.

## Global Output Contract

Apply this contract to every teammate prompt in this file:

- Write only your assigned output file under `{{FEATURE_DIR}}`.
- Do not edit any other files.
- After writing the file, verify it exists using the Read tool or equivalent.
- **Share key findings** with relevant teammates using SendMessage.
- After writing the file and sharing findings, mark your task as complete using TaskUpdate.
