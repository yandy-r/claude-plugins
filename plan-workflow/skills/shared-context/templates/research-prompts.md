# Research Agent Prompts

These prompts are used to deploy parallel research agents for gathering shared context.

## Global Output Contract

Apply this contract to every agent prompt in this file:

- Write only your assigned output file under `{{FEATURE_DIR}}`.
- Do not edit any other files.
- After writing the file, verify it exists using the Read tool or equivalent.
- After writing the file, return a short completion signal:
  - `STATUS: COMPLETE` or `STATUS: BLOCKED`
  - `OUTPUT: <path>`
  - `SECTIONS: <comma-separated headings>`

````markdown
Research the codebase architecture relevant to implementing "{{FEATURE_NAME}}".

## Your Task

Analyze the codebase to understand:

   - How is the codebase organized (directories, layers)?
   - What frameworks or libraries are in use?

2. **Data Flow**
   - How does data flow through the system?
   - What are the entry points (APIs, events, etc.)?
   - Where is business logic concentrated?

3. **Component Relationships**
   - How do components communicate?
   - What are the key dependencies?
   - Are there shared services or utilities?

4. **Integration Points**
   - Where would new feature code plug in?
   - What existing components would be affected?

## Output Requirements

**CRITICAL**: You MUST write your findings to the specified file. This is not optional.

**Output File**: {{FEATURE_DIR}}/research-architecture.md

Before completing this task:

1. Create the output file using the Write tool

3. Report completion status

Structure your report as:

```markdown
# Architecture Research: {{FEATURE_NAME}}

## Usage Instructions

When deploying research agents:

1. **Read this file** to get the prompt templates
2. **Substitute variables**:
   - `{{FEATURE_NAME}}` - The feature directory name (e.g., `user-authentication`)
   - `{{FEATURE_DIR}}` - Full output directory (e.g., `docs/plans/user-authentication`)
3. **Deploy in parallel** - Use a single message with 4 Task tool calls
4. **Wait for completion** - All agents must finish before consolidation
5. **Verify artifacts** - Check all research files exist on disk before proceeding
6. **Read results** - Review each research file before writing shared.md
