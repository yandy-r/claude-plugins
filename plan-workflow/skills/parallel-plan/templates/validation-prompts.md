# Validation Agent Prompts

These prompts are used to spawn validation teammates after creating a parallel plan. Validators cross-check each other's findings via messages.

---

## Agent 1: File Path Validator

**Teammate Name**: `path-validator`

**Subagent Type**: `explore`

**Task Description**: Verify file path references

**Prompt Template**:

```
Verify all file paths referenced in the parallel implementation plan exist in the codebase.

## Context

Read: {{FEATURE_DIR}}/parallel-plan.md

## Your Task

Scan the plan and check:

1. **Critically Relevant Files section**
   - Verify each listed file path exists
   - Check if paths are relative to project root

2. **Task Instructions**
   - Verify files in "READ THESE BEFORE TASK" sections
   - Check "Files to Create" for conflicts with existing files
   - Verify "Files to Modify" exist

3. **Documentation References**
   - Check any /docs/ references are valid

## Team Communication

You are part of a validation team. Your teammates are:

- **dependency-validator**: Checking the task dependency graph
- **completeness-validator**: Evaluating task quality and completeness

**Share these findings via SendMessage:**

- Message `dependency-validator` with: any tasks that reference files that don't exist (this may indicate dependency issues)
- Message `completeness-validator` with: any tasks with placeholder file paths or ambiguous references

## Task Coordination

1. Check TaskList for your assigned task
2. Claim your task with TaskUpdate (set status to in_progress, owner to your name)
3. Do your validation
4. Share findings with teammates
5. Mark your task complete with TaskUpdate

## Output Format

Provide a report with:

**Valid Paths** (checkmark)
- /path/to/file.ext
- /path/to/another.ext

**Missing Paths** (X)
- /path/to/nonexistent.ext - File not found
- /path/to/missing.ext - File not found

**Potential Issues** (warning)
- /path/to/file.ext - Listed in "Files to Create" but already exists
- /path/to/ambiguous - Multiple files match pattern

**Suggestions**
- Correct path for /wrong/path.ext might be /correct/path.ext
- Consider adding missing file references

Focus on accuracy - verify each path exists before marking valid.
```

## Agent 2: Dependency Graph Validator

**Teammate Name**: `dependency-validator`

**Subagent Type**: `explore`

**Task Description**: Analyze task dependencies

**Prompt Template**:

```
Analyze the task dependency graph in the parallel implementation plan for issues.

## Context

Read: {{FEATURE_DIR}}/parallel-plan.md

## Your Task

Extract all tasks and their dependencies, then check for:

1. **Circular Dependencies**
   - Tasks that depend on each other (directly or indirectly)
   - Example: Task 2.1 depends on 3.1, and 3.1 depends on 2.1

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Tasks that reference or modify files created by prior tasks
   - Tasks that should depend on each other but don't

3. **Orphaned Tasks**
   - Tasks that nothing depends on and don't contribute to later work

4. **Parallelization Opportunities**
   - Tasks marked as dependent that could actually run in parallel
   - Tasks that share no file modifications or data dependencies

## Team Communication

You are part of a validation team. Your teammates are:

- **path-validator**: Verifying file paths exist
- **completeness-validator**: Evaluating task quality and completeness

**Share these findings via SendMessage:**

- Message `path-validator` with: any tasks that create files used by dependent tasks (so path-validator can verify those files don't already exist)
- Message `completeness-validator` with: any orphaned tasks or bottleneck tasks that may need scope adjustment

**Listen for messages from teammates** — `path-validator` may report missing files that indicate dependency issues.

## Task Coordination

1. Check TaskList for your assigned task
2. Claim your task with TaskUpdate (set status to in_progress, owner to your name)
3. Do your validation
4. Share findings with teammates
5. Mark your task complete with TaskUpdate

## Output Format

**Dependency Graph** (text visualization)
```

Phase 1:
1.1 [none] ----+
1.2 [none] ----+--> Phase 2
1.3 [1.1] ----+

Phase 2:
2.1 [1.1, 1.2] ---> 2.3
2.2 [none] ---> 2.3
2.3 [2.1, 2.2]

```

**Issues Found**

Circular Dependencies: [count]
- Task 2.1 -> 3.1 -> 2.1 (circular)

Missing Dependencies: [count]
- Task 3.1 modifies file created in 2.2 but doesn't depend on it

Orphaned Tasks: [count]
- Task 1.3 creates file never used

**Parallelization Analysis**

Current parallelizable tasks: [count]
Potential additional parallel tasks: [count]
- Tasks 2.1 and 2.2 could run in parallel (no shared dependencies)

**Recommendations**
- Add dependency: 3.1 depends on [2.2]
- Consider removing orphaned task 1.3 or clarify its purpose
- Tasks 2.1 and 2.2 can be marked [none] to increase parallelism
```

## Agent 3: Task Completeness Validator

**Teammate Name**: `completeness-validator`

**Subagent Type**: `codebase-research-analyst`

**Task Description**: Evaluate task quality

**Prompt Template**:

```
Evaluate whether each task in the parallel implementation plan is actionable and complete.

## Context

Read:
- {{FEATURE_DIR}}/parallel-plan.md
- {{FEATURE_DIR}}/shared.md

## Your Task

For each task, evaluate:

1. **Clear Purpose**
   - Is it obvious what this task accomplishes?
   - Is the task title descriptive?

2. **Specific File Changes**
   - Are file paths specific (not placeholders)?
   - Are both creation and modification clear?

3. **Actionable Instructions**
   - Can a developer implement without guessing?
   - Are integration points clear?
   - Are patterns to follow specified?

4. **Gotchas Documented**
   - Are non-obvious issues mentioned?
   - Are dependencies on existing code noted?
   - Are edge cases addressed?

5. **Appropriate Scope**
   - Is the task small enough (1-3 files)?
   - Should it be broken into subtasks?

## Team Communication

You are part of a validation team. Your teammates are:

- **path-validator**: Verifying file paths exist
- **dependency-validator**: Checking the task dependency graph

**Share these findings via SendMessage:**

- Message `path-validator` with: any tasks you find with placeholder or suspicious file paths
- Message `dependency-validator` with: any tasks whose scope suggests they should have additional dependencies

**Listen for messages from teammates** — `path-validator` may report tasks with missing file references, and `dependency-validator` may report orphaned tasks that need scope review.

## Task Coordination

1. Check TaskList for your assigned task
2. Claim your task with TaskUpdate (set status to in_progress, owner to your name)
3. Do your validation
4. Share findings with teammates
5. Mark your task complete with TaskUpdate

## Output Format

**Task Quality Summary**

Total Tasks: [count]
High Quality: [count] (checkmark)
Needs Minor Improvements: [count] (warning)
Needs Significant Work: [count] (X)

**Detailed Findings**

(checkmark) Task 1.1: [Title] - Well-defined and actionable
(checkmark) Task 1.2: [Title] - Clear purpose and instructions

(warning) Task 2.1: [Title]
  - Missing: Gotchas or edge cases
  - Suggestion: Mention how this integrates with existing auth system

(warning) Task 2.3: [Title]
  - Issue: Scope too large (modifies 5 files)
  - Suggestion: Split into 2.3a and 2.3b

(X) Task 3.1: [Title]
  - Missing: Specific file paths (uses placeholders)
  - Missing: Clear instructions for implementation
  - Missing: Pattern to follow
  - Needs: Complete rewrite with specific details

**Recommendations**

Priority Improvements:
1. Task 3.1 - Add specific file paths and detailed instructions
2. Task 2.3 - Split into smaller tasks
3. Task 2.1 - Document integration gotchas

Overall Assessment:
[Summary of plan quality and readiness for implementation]

## Usage Instructions

When spawning validation teammates:

1. **Read this file** to get the prompt templates
2. **Substitute variables**:
   - `{{FEATURE_NAME}}` - The feature directory name
   - `{{FEATURE_DIR}}` - Full output directory path (`${feature_dir}`, resolved in Step 1)
3. **Create tasks** - Use TaskCreate to create 3 validation tasks
4. **Spawn in parallel** - Use a single message with 3 Agent tool calls, each with `team_name` and `name`
5. **Monitor progress** - Use TaskList to check when all tasks complete
6. **Review results** - Address issues found before finalizing plan
