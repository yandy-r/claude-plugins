# Review Fix

Plan and apply fixes for code-review findings. Reads a review artifact produced by `/code-review`, filters by severity, plans dependency-safe fix batches, dispatches `review-fixer` agents to apply each fix, updates the Status field in the review file in place, and writes a fix report.

> Adapted from PRPs-agentic-eng by Wirasm. Part of the PRP workflow series.

**Core philosophy**: The review artifact is the source of truth. Every finding has a stable ID and a Status field. This skill processes findings one at a time (or in parallel batches), updates the Status, and produces an auditable fix trail.

**Golden rule**: Never modify a finding's `Suggested fix` field. If a fix doesn't work as suggested, mark it `Failed` and let the human decide.

## Phase 0 — DETECT

### Flag Parsing

Extract flags from `$ARGUMENTS` before treating the remainder as the input:

| Flag                 | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--parallel`         | Dispatch `review-fixer` agents as **standalone sub-agents** in parallel per batch. Level 1+2 validation between batches. Fail-stop behavior. Works in opencode, Cursor, and Codex.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `--team`             | (Claude Code only) Same per-batch fixer fan-out as `--parallel`, but dispatched as an **agent team**: `spawn coordinated subagents` once, `track the task` for all eligible findings up front (flat graph — batches are orchestrator-controlled, not task-graph-controlled), per-batch spawn + shutdown via `send follow-up instructions`. Aborts if no eligible findings exist. |
| `--severity <level>` | Minimum severity to fix: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`. Default: `HIGH` (fixes CRITICAL + HIGH).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `--dry-run`          | Print the fix plan and stop. Do not dispatch fixers, do not modify any files. When combined with `--team`, also print the team name and per-batch teammate roster.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `--worktree`         | (legacy / now default; safe to omit) Run all fixers inside the feature worktree created by `/code-review`. Worktree mode is on by default; auto-detected from the `## Worktree Setup` section in the artifact. This flag is accepted as a no-op.                                                                                        |
| `--no-worktree`      | Opt out of worktree isolation. Skip parent-worktree setup; all fixes are applied directly in the current working tree. Use this when running against a non-worktree checkout and no `## Worktree Setup` section exists.                                                                                                                     |

Strip these flags from `$ARGUMENTS` and set `PARALLEL_MODE`, `AGENT_TEAM_MODE`, `MIN_SEVERITY`, `DRY_RUN`, and `WORKTREE_MODE=true` unless `--no-worktree` is present. The remaining text is the input selector.

**Validation**:

- `--parallel` and `--team` are **mutually exclusive**. If both are passed → abort with: `--parallel and --team are mutually exclusive. Pick one.`

**Compatibility note**: When this skill is invoked from a Cursor or Codex bundle, `--team` must not be used (those bundles ship without team tools). Use `--parallel` instead.

### Input Resolution

The artifact is now committed to the PR branch by `/code-review`. When you run `/review-fix` from a worktree of that branch, the artifact is in the worktree's `docs/prps/reviews/`. If not found there (e.g., legacy artifact still in main), fall back to the main repo's `docs/prps/reviews/`.

Determine the review artifact path from the stripped `$ARGUMENTS`:

| Input Pattern           | Detection                 | Action                                                              |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Path ending in `.md`    | Explicit review file path | Use as-is                                                           |
| Pure digits (e.g. `42`) | PR number                 | Resolve to `docs/prps/reviews/pr-42-review.md`                      |
| Empty / blank           | No input                  | Find latest file in `docs/prps/reviews/` and prompt user to confirm |

For the "find latest" case, use this two-pass discovery:

```bash
# Pass 1 — current worktree (or main if not in a worktree)
CURRENT_TOP=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
REVIEW_FILE=$(ls -t "${CURRENT_TOP}/docs/prps/reviews/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)

# Pass 2 — fall back to main repo when current lookup misses
if [[ -z "$REVIEW_FILE" ]]; then
  MAIN_TOP=$(cd "$(git rev-parse --git-common-dir)/.." && pwd)
  if [[ "$MAIN_TOP" != "$CURRENT_TOP" ]]; then
    REVIEW_FILE=$(ls -t "${MAIN_TOP}/docs/prps/reviews/"*.md 2>/dev/null | head -1)
  fi
fi
```

If no review file found:

```
Error: No review artifact found.
Run /code-review first to produce a review artifact.
```

Verify the file exists before proceeding:

```bash
test -f "$REVIEW_FILE" || { echo "Error: review file not found: $REVIEW_FILE"; exit 1; }
```

### Package Manager Detection

Detect the project type-check and test commands (used for between-batch validation in parallel mode and for passing to each `review-fixer` agent):

| File Exists         | Stack  | Type-check                      | Tests           |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `bun.lockb`         | bun    | `bun run typecheck`             | `bun test`      |
| `pnpm-lock.yaml`    | pnpm   | `pnpm typecheck` / `pnpm tsc`   | `pnpm test`     |
| `yarn.lock`         | yarn   | `yarn typecheck`                | `yarn test`     |
| `package-lock.json` | npm    | `npx tsc --noEmit`              | `npm test`      |
| `Cargo.toml`        | cargo  | `cargo check`                   | `cargo test`    |
| `go.mod`            | go     | `go vet ./...`                  | `go test ./...` |
| `pyproject.toml`    | python | project-specific (mypy/pyright) | `pytest`        |

Record the commands as `TYPECHECK_CMD` and `TEST_CMD` for later phases.

---

## Phase 1 — LOAD

Read the review artifact:

```bash
cat "$REVIEW_FILE"
```

Parse the `## Findings` section. For each `### <SEVERITY>` block, extract every finding matching this pattern:

```
- **[F###]** `file:line` — description
  - **Status**: Open | Fixed | Failed
  - **Category**: <category>
  - **Suggested fix**: <fix>
```

Build an in-memory list of `Finding` objects with fields:

- `id` (e.g., `F042`)
- `severity` (`CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`)
- `file`
- `line`
- `description`
- `status`
- `category`
- `suggested_fix`

If the file is not in the expected format or no findings are found, stop with:

```
Error: Review file has no parseable findings or is not in the expected format.
See the Review Artifact Format section of /code-review.
```

If every finding already has `Status: Fixed` or `Status: Failed`, stop with:

```
All findings in this review have already been processed.
  Fixed:  N
  Failed: M
Nothing to do.
```

**CHECKPOINT**: Review loaded. All findings parsed. At least one `Status: Open` finding exists.

### Worktree Setup detection (auto or forced)

After parsing findings, scan the artifact for `^## Worktree Setup`:

**If the section is present** (auto-detect):

Parse the block into structured variables:

- `PARENT_PATH` from `- **Parent**: <path> (branch: <branch>)` → capture `<path>` and `<branch>`
- `PARENT_BRANCH` from the same line

Set `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true` regardless of the `--worktree` flag (auto-detect: the artifact's declaration wins).

Verify the parent worktree still exists on disk:

```bash
if [[ ! -d "$PARENT_PATH" ]]; then
  echo "Error: parent worktree $PARENT_PATH is declared in the review artifact but does not exist."
  echo "Re-run /code-review --worktree <N> to recreate it, then retry."
  exit 1
fi
```

**If the section is absent and `WORKTREE_MODE=false`**:

Set `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=false`. Fall through to Phase 2 unchanged (legacy path).

**If the section is absent and `WORKTREE_MODE=true` (forced)**:

Deduce paths from the artifact filename:

- For `pr-<N>-review.md`: slug = `pr-<N>`; resolve PR head:

  ```bash
  PR_NUMBER=$(basename "$REVIEW_FILE" | sed -E 's/^pr-([0-9]+)-review\.md$/\1/')
  PR_HEAD=$(gh pr view "$PR_NUMBER" --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
  REPO=$(basename "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)")
  PARENT_PATH=$(bash "~/.config/opencode/shared/scripts/setup-worktree.sh" \
    parent "$REPO" "pr-$PR_NUMBER" --base-ref "$PR_HEAD")
  PARENT_BRANCH="$PR_HEAD"
  ```

- For `local-<ts>-review.md`: abort with:

  ```
  Error: --worktree cannot be force-applied to a local review artifact that was produced without worktree isolation. Re-run /code-review --worktree to regenerate.
  ```

Set `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`. All batches will run inside `$PARENT_PATH`.

---

## Phase 2 — FILTER

Apply filters in this order, tracking what was dropped and why:

### 2a. Status filter

Keep only findings with `Status: Open`. Already-`Fixed` and already-`Failed` findings are preserved in the file but not re-processed.

### 2b. Severity filter

Compare each finding's severity against `MIN_SEVERITY` using this order: `CRITICAL > HIGH > MEDIUM > LOW`. Drop findings below the threshold.

### 2c. Fix-suggestion filter

Drop findings without a non-empty `Suggested fix` field. These require human judgment and are not safe to auto-apply.

### 2d. Missing-file filter

For each remaining finding, verify the file exists:

```bash
test -f "$FILE"
```

Drop findings whose file no longer exists (likely already refactored).

### 2e. Report filter results

Print a summary:

```
Filter Results:
  Total findings:              N
  Already Fixed:               A
  Already Failed:              B
  Below severity threshold:    C  (threshold: HIGH)
  No suggested fix:            D
  Missing files:               E
  Eligible for fixing:         M
```

If `M == 0`, stop with: "No eligible findings to fix."

---

## Phase 3 — PLAN

Group the eligible findings into batches. The goal is maximum parallelism without write conflicts.

### Batching rules

1. **Findings in the same file go in the same group.** Concurrent edits to one file cause write conflicts, so same-file findings are ALWAYS processed sequentially within a single `review-fixer` agent.
2. **Findings in different files are parallel candidates.** They can go in the same batch and be dispatched concurrently.
3. **Within a same-file group, sort by line number DESCENDING.** This ensures earlier edits don't shift the line numbers of later findings.
4. **Severity ordering across batches**: process CRITICAL findings first, then HIGH, then MEDIUM, then LOW. This gives the user the highest-value fixes immediately and ensures that if the pipeline stops mid-run, the worst issues are addressed first.

### Batch construction algorithm

```
1. Group eligible findings by file → same_file_groups[]
2. Sort same_file_groups by max severity of the group (CRITICAL first)
3. For each severity level (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM, LOW):
     - Collect all same_file_groups whose MAX severity matches this level
     - If those groups are all for different files, they become one batch (parallel-eligible)
     - Otherwise split into multiple batches (unlikely since groups are keyed by file)
4. Within each group, sort findings by line number DESCENDING
```

### Display the plan

```
Fix Plan:
  Eligible findings:  M
  Same-file groups:   G
  Batches:            B
  Max parallel width: W  (largest batch size)

Batch 1 (CRITICAL, 3 fixes, 3 files):
  - F001 (src/auth.ts:42)     SQL injection in user lookup
  - F002 (src/api.ts:17)      Missing null check
  - F003 (src/db/query.ts:8)  Unescaped input

Batch 2 (HIGH, 2 fixes, 1 file with 2 findings):
  - src/utils/format.ts:
      - F005 (line 112) Function exceeds 50 lines
      - F004 (line 78)  Missing error handling

...
```

### Worktree-mode batching override (`WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`)

When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`, override the default same-file batching with severity-keyed batching:

- **Batch N = all eligible findings at one severity level.**
- Batch order: CRITICAL (Batch 1) → HIGH (Batch 2) → MEDIUM (Batch 3) → LOW (Batch 4), stopping at `MIN_SEVERITY`. Severities with no eligible findings are skipped.
- Within a severity batch, preserve the existing same-file grouping (findings in the same file stay together, sorted by line DESCENDING). Different files within the batch can still parallelize under Path B/C.
  Example plan summary when `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`:

```
Worktree-mode plan (4 severity batches, 7 findings, 5 files):

Batch 1 — CRITICAL (2 fixes, 2 files)
  - F001 (src/auth.ts:42)
  - F002 (src/api.ts:17)

Batch 2 — HIGH (3 fixes, 2 files)
  - F003 (src/db/query.ts:112)
  - F004 (src/db/query.ts:87)     ← same file as F003, descending line order
  - F005 (src/utils/format.ts:9)

Batch 3 — MEDIUM (1 fix, 1 file)
  - F006 (src/logging.ts:45)

(LOW batch skipped — 0 eligible findings or below MIN_SEVERITY)
```

When `--dry-run` is combined with `--worktree`, print this summary and exit. All batches would run inside the parent worktree at `$PARENT_PATH`.

### Dry-run gate

If `DRY_RUN=true` and `AGENT_TEAM_MODE=false`, stop here. Print a reminder:

```
Dry run complete. To apply fixes, re-run without --dry-run:
  /review-fix $REVIEW_FILE [--parallel | --team] [--severity <level>]
```

If `DRY_RUN=true` and `AGENT_TEAM_MODE=true`, defer the final exit to Phase 4 C.2 so the team name and per-batch teammate roster can be printed alongside the fix plan. Do NOT proceed to any team/task/agent tool calls.

**CHECKPOINT**: Plan built. Batches computed. User has seen the plan.

---

## Phase 4 — EXECUTE

Branch based on `PARALLEL_MODE` and `AGENT_TEAM_MODE`:

| Flags             | Path                                               |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Neither set       | **Path A** — sequential execution (default)        |
| `PARALLEL_MODE`   | **Path B** — parallel standalone sub-agent batches |
| `AGENT_TEAM_MODE` | **Path C** — agent-team batch execution            |

### Worktree-mode lifecycle (`WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`)

When worktree mode is active, every batch — regardless of Path A / B / C — runs
inside the single feature worktree from
`.opencode-plugin/skills/_shared/references/worktree-strategy.md` §1. There are no per-severity
child worktrees and no fan-in merge.

**One-time parent setup** (only when `WORKTREE_MODE=true` was forced and
`$PARENT_PATH` needs creation; skip if already ensured by `/code-review`):

```bash
PARENT_PATH=$(bash "~/.config/opencode/shared/scripts/setup-worktree.sh" \
  parent "${REPO}" "${SLUG}" --base-ref "${PARENT_BRANCH}")
WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true
```

**Per-batch steps** (repeat for each severity batch in order):

1. **Dispatch** review-fixer agents with `Working directory: $PARENT_PATH` appended to
   their prompt, plus the coordination note: "Other agents in this batch are working
   in the same directory — do not run destructive git commands (reset, clean, checkout)."
   Do **not** pass `isolation: "worktree"` here; that creates a separate harness worktree per review-fixer and breaks the single-worktree contract.

2. **Validate** inside `$PARENT_PATH` after the batch completes:

   ```bash
   ( cd "$PARENT_PATH" && $TYPECHECK_CMD ) && ( cd "$PARENT_PATH" && $TEST_CMD )
   ```

3. **Advance** to the next severity batch. No merge step. No child worktree removal.

**Status updates**: Edit the `Status:` field in the review artifact file in place
(Open → Fixed / Failed) after each agent completes its finding. The artifact lives
in the active worktree at `$PARENT_PATH/docs/prps/reviews/pr-<N>-review.md`.

### Path A — Sequential Execution (default)

- When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`: every review-fixer dispatch in this path appends `Working directory: ${PARENT_PATH}` to the agent prompt. Do **not** add `isolation: "worktree"`; that would allocate separate harness worktrees per agent. After each severity batch, run the between-batch validation inside `${PARENT_PATH}` before advancing to the next severity.

Process batches in order. Within each batch, process findings (or same-file groups) one at a time.

For each finding or group:

1. **Dispatch a single `review-fixer` agent** with the Finding spec (Shape A for single, Shape B for same-file group). Include `SOURCE REVIEW FILE` and `PROJECT TYPE-CHECK COMMAND` in the prompt.

2. **Wait for the agent to return** its success or failure report.

3. **Update the source review file in place**:
   - On `STATUS: Fixed` → use `Edit` to change the finding's `**Status**: Open` line to `**Status**: Fixed`
   - On `STATUS: Failed` → use `Edit` to change the finding's `**Status**: Open` line to `**Status**: Failed`

4. **Track progress** in a todo list:
   - `[done] F042 — Fixed`
   - `[failed] F043 — Failed: <blocker>`

5. **Continue** to the next finding. Do NOT stop on a failure — continue processing remaining findings so the user gets a full picture.

### Path B — Parallel Sub-Agent Execution (`PARALLEL_MODE=true`)

- When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`: batches are still severity-ordered. Dispatch every parallel review-fixer with `Working directory: ${PARENT_PATH}` only. Do **not** add `isolation: "worktree"`. Between-batch validation runs once in `${PARENT_PATH}` before advancing to the next severity. No fan-in merge.

Process batches sequentially; within each batch, dispatch all review-fixer agents as standalone sub-agents in parallel.

For each batch:

1. **Dispatch review-fixer agents in parallel** — Use a **SINGLE message** with **MULTIPLE `Agent` tool calls**, one per finding or same-file group in the batch:
   - `subagent_type`: `"review-fixer"`
   - `description`: e.g., `"Fix F042: missing null check in payments.ts"`
   - `prompt`: The Finding spec (Shape A or Shape B) plus `SOURCE REVIEW FILE` and `PROJECT TYPE-CHECK COMMAND`

2. **Wait for all agents in the batch to complete** before proceeding.

3. **Collect results and update the review file**:
   - For each `STATUS: Fixed` → `Edit` the review file to update that finding's `**Status**: Open` → `**Status**: Fixed`
   - For each `STATUS: Failed` → `Edit` the review file to update that finding's `**Status**: Open` → `**Status**: Failed`

4. **Between-batch validation (Levels 1 + 2)** — After each batch (except the last), run:

   ```bash
   $TYPECHECK_CMD
   $TEST_CMD
   ```

   - If both pass: log `[done] Batch N: K fixes — validation pass` and proceed.
   - If either fails: **STOP** the parallel pipeline. Report which batch broke validation. Use `ask the user` to ask:
     - "Resume sequentially from next batch"
     - "Abort and leave current state as-is"
     - "Skip remaining findings and jump to Phase 5 (verify + report)"

5. **Track progress** in todos per batch, not per finding.

### Handling failures

If a `review-fixer` agent returns `STATUS: Failed`:

- **Do NOT retry** the same fix automatically. The agent already judged the Suggested fix to be incompatible.
- Mark the finding as `Failed` in the review file.
- Include the agent's `BLOCKER` and `RECOMMENDATION` in the fix report.
- Continue with remaining findings.

### Path C — Agent Team Execution (`AGENT_TEAM_MODE=true`, Claude Code only)

- When `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`: batches are still severity-ordered. Dispatch teammates with `Working directory: ${PARENT_PATH}` only. Do **not** add `isolation: "worktree"`. Before advancing to the next severity batch, send `send follow-up instructions(shutdown)` to all current batch teammates, then run between-batch validation inside `${PARENT_PATH}`. No fan-in merge.

> **MANDATORY — AGENT TEAMS REQUIRED**
>
> In Path C you MUST follow the agent-team lifecycle. Do NOT mix standalone sub-agents
> with team dispatch. Every `Agent` call below MUST include `team_name=` AND `name=`.
>
> 1. `spawn coordinated subagents` ONCE at the start (single team across all batches)
> 2. `track the task` for **every eligible finding (or same-file group) across all batches**
>    up front. Flat graph — no `addBlockedBy` wiring, because batch ordering is
>    orchestrator-controlled, not task-graph-controlled. Each batch is processed only
>    after the previous one's teammates are shut down.
> 3. Per batch: spawn teammates (single message, multiple `Agent` calls with
>    `team_name=` + `name=`)
> 4. `the todo tracker` to confirm batch completion; run between-batch validation
> 5. `send follow-up instructions({type:"shutdown_request"})` to all teammates of completed batch
>    BEFORE spawning next batch
> 6. `end the coordinated run` ONCE after final batch (or on abort)
>
> If `spawn coordinated subagents` or up-front `track the task` fails, abort the skill. Refer to
> `~/.config/opencode/shared/references/agent-team-dispatch.md`
> for the full lifecycle contract.

Process batches sequentially under a single team, with per-batch teammate spawn and inter-batch shutdown. Use this when the fix run spans many findings across multiple batches and you want a shared task graph for audit/visibility, or when fixers should be able to cross-reference each other via `send follow-up instructions` (e.g., if fixing F003 reveals the same root cause as F007 in a different file).

#### C.1 Build the team name

Derive `<sanitized-review-name>` from the source review file basename:

- Strip the `.md` extension.
- Lowercase; replace non-`[a-z0-9-]` with `-`; collapse runs of `-`; trim; truncate to **20 characters** max.
- Fall back to `untitled` if empty.

Team name: `rfix-<sanitized-review-name>`.

Example: `docs/prps/reviews/pr-42-review.md` → `rfix-pr-42-review`.
Example: `docs/prps/reviews/local-20260408-143022-review.md` → `rfix-local-20260408-1` (truncated to 20 chars).

#### C.2 Dry-run gate (if `DRY_RUN=true`)

The Phase 3 plan has already been printed. Additionally print:

```
Team name:    rfix-<sanitized-review-name>
Total tasks:  <M>  (eligible findings, across <B> batches, max parallel width <W>)
Dependencies: none  (batches are orchestrator-controlled; task graph is flat)

Per-batch teammate roster:
  Batch 1 (<severity>, <count> fixes):
    - <task-id-1>  subagent_type=review-fixer  finding=<F###: short>
    - <task-id-2>  subagent_type=review-fixer  finding=<F###: short>
  Batch 2 (...):
    ...
```

Do **not** call any team/task/agent tools. Exit the skill.

#### C.3 Create the team

```
spawn coordinated subagents: team_name="rfix-<sanitized-review-name>", description="Review-fix team for: <source review basename>"
```

On failure, abort.

#### C.4 Register ALL eligible tasks up front (flat graph)

For **every eligible finding or same-file group across all batches** (from the Phase 3 plan):

```
track the task: subject="<task-id>: fix <F###> in <file>", description="<full Finding spec — Shape A for single finding, Shape B for same-file group — plus SOURCE REVIEW FILE and PROJECT TYPE-CHECK COMMAND>"
```

Use stable task IDs derived from the primary finding ID, e.g.:

- Single finding `F042` in `src/api.ts` → task id `f042`
- Same-file group `F004, F005` in `src/utils/fmt.ts` → task id `f004-f005`

**No `addBlockedBy` wiring.** Batch ordering is enforced by the orchestrator (per-batch spawn + shutdown), not by the shared task graph. The shared task list's role in Path C is observability and inter-fixer communication, not dependency resolution.

If any `track the task` fails → `end the coordinated run`, then abort.

#### C.5 Per-batch loop

For each batch `B1, B2, ... BN` in order (from the Phase 3 plan):

1. **Identify batch tasks** — Extract all task IDs for findings (or same-file groups) in this batch.

2. **Spawn batch teammates** — Single message, multiple `Agent` tool calls, one per finding or same-file group in the batch. Every call MUST include:
   - `team_name`: `"rfix-<sanitized-review-name>"`
   - `name`: the task ID (e.g., `"f042"`, `"f004-f005"`) — must match the `track the task` subject prefix
   - `subagent_type`: `"review-fixer"`
   - `description`: One-line fix title (e.g., `"Fix F042: missing null check in api.ts"`)
   - `prompt`: The Finding spec (Shape A or Shape B) plus `SOURCE REVIEW FILE`, `PROJECT TYPE-CHECK COMMAND`, and a directive that the teammate shares a task list with sibling fixers (list their task IDs) and may `send follow-up instructions` them if a related finding becomes relevant, and must call `update the todo tracker` to mark its task complete before returning.

3. **Wait for batch completion via `the todo tracker`** — poll until all tasks in this batch are `completed`. If a teammate messages with an issue, respond via `send follow-up instructions` with guidance.

4. **Collect results and update the review file** — For each completed task, the teammate returns `STATUS: Fixed` or `STATUS: Failed`:
   - For each `STATUS: Fixed` → `Edit` the review file to update that finding's `**Status**: Open` → `**Status**: Fixed`
   - For each `STATUS: Failed` → `Edit` the review file to update that finding's `**Status**: Open` → `**Status**: Failed`

5. **Between-batch validation (Levels 1 + 2)** — After each batch (except the last), run:

   ```bash
   $TYPECHECK_CMD
   $TEST_CMD
   ```

   - If both pass: log `[done] Batch N: K fixes — validation pass` and proceed.
   - If either fails: **STOP** the pipeline. Use `ask the user`:
     - "Resume sequentially from next batch" — shut down current batch, `end the coordinated run`, continue with Path A logic for remaining batches.
     - "Switch to parallel sub-agents for remaining batches" — shut down current batch, `end the coordinated run`, continue with Path B for remaining batches.
     - "Abort and leave current state as-is" — shut down current batch, `end the coordinated run`, exit.
     - "Skip remaining findings and jump to Phase 5 (verify + report)" — shut down current batch, `end the coordinated run`, jump to Phase 5.

6. **Shut down completed-batch teammates** — Send to every teammate of the just-completed batch:

   ```
   send follow-up instructions(to="<task-id>", message={type:"shutdown_request"})
   ```

   Wait for shutdowns to complete before spawning the next batch's teammates.

7. **Track progress** in todos per batch, not per finding.

#### C.6 After all batches complete

`end the coordinated run` once. Then proceed to **Phase 5 — VERIFY** as normal.

#### Path C failure handling

Same principles as Path B: do NOT auto-retry failed fixes, do NOT skip a failed batch. Always shut down teammates and `end the coordinated run` before exiting, regardless of success or failure. Review file updates happen incrementally after each batch returns, so an aborted Path C run leaves the source review file reflecting the last completed batch's state.

**CHECKPOINT**: All eligible batches processed. Review file updated with Fixed/Failed statuses. Deviations logged.

---

## Phase 5 — VERIFY

Run project-level validation on the final state:

```bash
$TYPECHECK_CMD
$TEST_CMD
```

Record pass/fail for each. Do NOT rollback fixes on failure — the user decides what to do. This phase is diagnostic: it tells the user whether the codebase is in a good state after all fixes landed.

---

## Phase 6 — REPORT

### Create the fix report

Write the fix report to `$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/docs/prps/reviews/fixes/`. When in a worktree this resolves to the worktree top-level; otherwise to the main repo.

```bash
mkdir -p "$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/docs/prps/reviews/fixes"
```

Derive the report filename from the source review:

| Source                                              | Report                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs/prps/reviews/pr-42-review.md`                 | `docs/prps/reviews/fixes/pr-42-fixes.md`                 |
| `docs/prps/reviews/local-20260408-143022-review.md` | `docs/prps/reviews/fixes/local-20260408-143022-fixes.md` |

After writing the fix report, stage and commit it to the PR branch alongside the fix commits:

```bash
FIX_REPORT_REL="docs/prps/reviews/fixes/<name>-fixes.md"
git add "$FIX_REPORT_REL"
git commit -m "docs(review): add fix report for PR #${PR_NUMBER}"
git push
```

## Files Changed

- `src/auth.ts` (Fixed F001)
- `src/api.ts` (Fixed F002)
- `src/utils/fmt.ts` (Fixed F004, F005)

## Failed Fixes

### F003 — `src/db/query.ts:8`

**Severity**: HIGH
**Category**: Security
**Description**: Unescaped input in raw SQL query
**Suggested fix (from review)**: Use `db.query('... WHERE id = $1', [userId])`
**Blocker**: `Property 'query' does not exist on type 'Connection'`. The connection type in this codebase exposes `execute`, not `query`.
**Recommendation**: Update the review's Suggested fix to use `db.execute(...)` and re-run `/review-fix`.

## Validation Results

| Check      | Result                |
| ---------- | --------------------- |
| Type check | Pass / Fail / Skipped |
| Tests      | Pass / Fail / Skipped |

## Next Steps

- Re-run `/code-review <same target>` to verify the remaining open findings and confirm fixes resolved the issues
- Address failed fixes manually using the Blocker + Recommendation notes above
- Run `/git-workflow --commit` to commit the changes when satisfied
```

### Worktree Summary (only when `WORKTREE_ACTIVE=true`)

At the end of REPORT, append to the fix report:

```markdown
## Worktree Summary

<output of list-worktrees.sh>

### Next steps

- Review the parent worktree: `git -C <PARENT_PATH> log --oneline -10`
- Push to update the PR: `git -C <PARENT_PATH> push origin HEAD`
- Clean up when done: `git worktree remove <PARENT_PATH>`
```

Populate the `<output of list-worktrees.sh>` block by running:

```bash
bash "~/.config/opencode/shared/scripts/list-worktrees.sh" \
  "${REPO}" "${SLUG}"
```

## Handling Edge Cases

### No `Status` field on a finding

The review artifact format requires `Status` on every finding. If a finding lacks a `Status` line, treat it as `Status: Open` but print a warning:

```
Warning: Finding F### has no Status field. Treating as Open.
Fix the source review file format — see the Review Artifact Format section of /code-review.
```

### File was modified between review and fix

If the finding's line number no longer points to the described code (because the file changed since the review was written), the `review-fixer` agent will detect this and return `STATUS: Failed` with a stale-line blocker. Mark the finding as `Failed` in the review file and include "stale line — file modified since review" in the report notes.

### Review file points to a deleted file

Covered by the missing-file filter in Phase 2. Skipped, not Failed.

### Fix introduces new findings

`/review-fix` does not recursively scan for new findings. Re-run `/code-review` after fixes to catch any regressions.

### User interrupts mid-run

The review file is updated incrementally after each agent returns, so if the run is interrupted, the file reflects the current partial state. Re-running `/review-fix` on the same review file will skip findings that are already `Fixed` or `Failed` and resume from the next `Open` one.

---

## Success Criteria

- **PLAN_VALID**: The fix plan respects same-file sequentialization and different-file parallelism
- **REVIEW_UPDATED**: Every attempted finding has its `Status` updated in the source review file
- **REPORT_CREATED**: A fix report is written to `docs/prps/reviews/fixes/`
- **VALIDATION_RUN**: Phase 5 type-check + tests completed (even if they failed)
- **REPORT_COMMITTED**: The fix report is committed and pushed to the PR branch alongside the fix commits (in worktree mode). In `--no-worktree` mode, the report is written to disk; no automatic commit is made.

| `/review-fix` (this)     | Consumes a review artifact and applies fixes, updating `Status` to `Fixed` or `Failed`           |
| `/prp-implement`         | Executes a PRP plan file with per-task validation — a different workflow, different input format |

## Important Notes

- **In-place Status updates**: The source review file is the source of truth. This skill mutates it in place via `Edit`, updating only the `Status` line of each processed finding. All other content is preserved.
- **No scope creep**: Each `review-fixer` agent is scope-disciplined — it fixes exactly what the finding specifies. If the fix reveals a larger issue, the agent reports it, but the skill does not chase down related problems.
- **Resumable**: Re-running on the same review file skips already-processed findings.
- **Audit trail**: The combination of (a) updated source review file and (b) fix report gives a complete history of what was attempted, what succeeded, and why.
- **Parallel safety**: Parallel mode (both Path B sub-agents and Path C agent team) never dispatches two agents to the same file concurrently — same-file findings always travel together in one fixer.
- **Commits in worktree mode**: In worktree mode (the default), the skill commits the fix report alongside fix commits and pushes to the PR branch. In `--no-worktree` mode, no automatic commit is made — run `/git-workflow --commit` when ready.
- Does NOT automatically open a follow-up PR. After fixes land, the parent worktree's branch already has all commits pushed; the user decides when to request a re-review.
