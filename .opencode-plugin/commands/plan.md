# Plan Command

Create a quick implementation plan and wait for user approval.

**Load and follow the `plan` skill, passing through `$ARGUMENTS`.**

This is the lightweight planner. For an artifact-producing plan with codebase pattern extraction, use `/prp-plan`. For parallel-agent planning, use `/plan-workflow`.

**Flags**:

- `--parallel` — Instruct the `planner` agent to shape its output for parallel execution: adds a `Batches` summary section, uses hierarchical step IDs (`1.1`, `1.2`, `2.1`), and populates `Depends on [...]` annotations on every step. After confirmation, execute in-conversation via `implementor` agents per batch, or save to a file and hand off to `/prp-implement --parallel`. Does NOT fan out research agents — the planner still does its own codebase reads. For research fan-out, use `/prp-plan --parallel`.
- `--team` — (Claude Code only) Dispatch a 3-persona planning team under a shared `spawn coordinated subagents`/`the todo tracker` with coordinated shutdown: `architect` (`planner`) for the structural plan, `risk-analyst` (`codebase-research-analyst`) for risks and edge cases, `test-strategist` (`test-strategy-planner`) for the testing strategy. All 3 outputs are merged into one unified plan. Heavier than the default single-agent path — use for complex features where you want multiple perspectives. Cursor and Codex bundles lack team tools; use `--parallel` there instead.
- `--dry-run` — Only valid with `--team`. Prints the team name and teammate roster, then exits without spawning any teammates.
- `--worktree` — (legacy — now default; pass `--no-worktree` to opt out) Worktree annotations are emitted by default. This flag is accepted as a silent no-op so existing pipelines continue to work.
- `--no-worktree` — Opt out of worktree annotations. The plan will not contain a `## Worktree Setup` section or per-task `**Worktree**:` annotations.

`--parallel` and `--team` are **independent and combinable**. `--parallel` shapes the plan's output format; `--team` switches the dispatch mechanism. Pass both for a multi-perspective plan formatted for parallel execution.

```
Usage: /plan [--parallel] [--team] [--dry-run] [--no-worktree] <what you want to plan>

Examples:
  /plan add real-time notifications when a market resolves
  /plan --parallel refactor the auth middleware to use the new session store
  /plan --team add rate limiting to the API gateway
  /plan --parallel --team add rate limiting to the API gateway
  /plan --team --dry-run add rate limiting to the API gateway      # preview team only
  /plan --parallel add a billing dashboard                          # worktree annotations included by default
  /plan --no-worktree --parallel add a billing dashboard            # skip worktree annotations

The skill will:
  1. Parse flags and restate requirements in clear terms
  2. Identify risks and dependencies
  3. Break implementation into phases (with batches if --parallel)
  4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before any code is written
```
