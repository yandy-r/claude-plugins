#!/usr/bin/env bash
# merge-children.sh — DEPRECATED compatibility shim (issue #80, single worktree
# contract). Does NOT merge branches, remove worktrees, or delete branches.
#
# The historical behavior (fan-in merge from per-task child worktrees) was
# unsafe and is removed. Callers that still invoke this script get an explicit
# deprecation message on stderr, confirmation that the feature worktree exists
# (when it does), and exit 0 so orchestration does not break before skills are
# updated.
#
# Usage: merge-children.sh <repo-name> <feature-slug> <task-id>[,<task-id>,...]
#        (task-ids are accepted for argument compatibility; they are not used)
#
# Exit codes:
#   0  always (shim: no fan-in, no errors from missing children)

DEPRECATED: This script is a no-op. ycc uses one feature worktree per run; there
is no per-task child merge. Remove calls to merge-children.sh in favor of working
entirely in the path printed by: setup-worktree.sh parent <repo> <feature-slug>
